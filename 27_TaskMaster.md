   - Display insights like **expected completion rate**, **overdue trends**, and **bottlenecks**.
   - AI should **analyze task descriptions, deadlines, and team communication** to suggest **priority adjustments**.

2. **Outcome Prediction Based on Pace**:

   - Based on the **current pace of task completion**, predict the **probable outcomes** (e.g., project on track or delays expected).
   - Provide **suggestions to improve task management** based on predictions.

3. **Advanced Deadline Management**:

   - Automatically **adjust deadlines** if preceding tasks are delayed.
   - **Notify users of potential cascading delays** due to missed deadlines.
