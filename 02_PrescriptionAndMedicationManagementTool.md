### **Prescription and Medication Management Tool**

**Context:**  
Medication management is crucial for patients, particularly those with chronic conditions requiring ongoing prescriptions. Many patients struggle to remember medication schedules, keep track of prescriptions, and renew them on time. A well-designed tool that simplifies medication management can significantly enhance patient adherence and improve health outcomes by reducing missed doses and delayed prescription renewals.

**Project Goal:**  
The goal of this project is to develop a modern, responsive tool that empowers users to manage their medications effortlessly. This tool will focus on providing timely reminders, simplifying prescription renewals, and offering a clear history of medication usage. The platform will prioritize user-friendly, interactive interfaces that ensure patients can easily navigate their medication schedules and stay on top of their healthcare needs.
