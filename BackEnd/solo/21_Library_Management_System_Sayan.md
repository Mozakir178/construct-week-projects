### **Library Management System**

**Context**: Libraries are essential resources for students, professionals, and the public to access information and knowledge. Managing a libraryâ€™s collection, keeping track of borrowed books, and monitoring user activity are crucial tasks that ensure the efficient functioning of a library. A digital library management system can help automate these processes, making it easier to manage inventory, monitor borrowing trends, and provide seamless access to users.

**Objective**: The goal of this project is to develop a Library Management System where users (borrowers) can browse the book catalog, borrow/return books, and track their borrowing history. Admin users (library staff) can manage the inventory, track borrowing activities, generate reports, and send notifications to users. The system will also provide visual insights through data visualization and allow both admins and users to export relevant data.

**Key Features**:

- **User Authentication & Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:  
  - Implement a secure login system with different roles: Admin (library staff), Users (borrowers), and Guests (viewers).
  - Admins can manage inventory, track borrowing activity, and generate reports, while users can borrow/return books, and guests can browse the collection.

- **Book Inventory Management**:  
  - Admins can add, update, or remove books from the library's collection.  
  - Implement features like categorizing books by genre, author, and publication date.
  - Keep track of stock levels (number of copies available) for each book.

- **Book Borrowing & Return System**:  
  - Users can borrow books for a set period. The system should track due dates and calculate late fees if applicable.
  - Users can also return books, and the system should update the inventory and user borrowing history accordingly.

- **Search & Filter**:  
  - Allow users to search for books by title, author, genre, or availability.
  - Implement filtering options to help users find books based on specific criteria like most popular or recently added books.

- **Data Visualization**:  
  - Provide admin users with reports and charts that display library trends, such as the most borrowed books, late returns, and user activity.
  - Visualize statistics like the total number of borrowed books, most popular genres, and borrowing patterns over time.

- **Notifications & Alerts**:  
  - Send automated email or SMS notifications to users when their borrowed books are nearing the due date or if they have overdue items.
  - Notify admins when stock levels of certain books are low.

- **File Uploads**:  
  - Allow admin users to upload book-related materials (e.g., PDF copies of books, covers, or other documents).
  - Ensure that uploaded files are securely stored and retrievable by users based on their permissions.

- **Export Data**:  
  - Provide the ability for admins to export library data (e.g., borrowing history, book inventory, user activity) as CSV or PDF files for reporting and analysis.
  - Allow users to export their borrowing history as a PDF for personal tracking.

- **API Testing & Validation**:  
  - Test API endpoints for book inventory management, borrowing/returning books, and report generation.
  - Implement validation to ensure proper handling of requests, such as preventing duplicate book entries or borrowing beyond the limit.

- **User Recommendations**:  
  - Implement a system that recommends books to users based on their borrowing history and reading preferences.

- **Book Reviews & Ratings**:  
  - Allow users to leave reviews and rate the books they have borrowed, helping others find popular reads.

- **Fine Tracking & Payment**:  
  - Implement a system to track fines for late returns and allow users to pay them through the platform.
