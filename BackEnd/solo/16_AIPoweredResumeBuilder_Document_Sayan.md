### **AI-Powered Resume Builder**

**Context**:  
In today’s competitive job market, crafting a resume that stands out is challenging for many job seekers, especially those with limited experience in creating professional resumes. The process of highlighting relevant skills, experience, and qualifications to match industry trends requires both expertise and effort. An AI-powered resume-building platform simplifies this task by offering intelligent suggestions and market-driven insights, allowing users to tailor their resumes to specific job roles and industries.

**Objective**:  
The goal of this project is to develop an AI-powered platform that helps users create professional and optimized resumes. Users will be able to generate resumes dynamically, receive real-time feedback from AI on content and formatting, and leverage job market data to enhance their resumes. The platform will allow for multi-resume management, export functionality, and provide analytics to guide users in improving their chances of securing job interviews.
