### Ride-Sharing Application

**Context**:  
This platform aims to revolutionize urban transportation by connecting riders with drivers for efficient and convenient ride-sharing services. Users will be able to book rides effortlessly, while drivers can manage ride requests, enhancing overall mobility within cities. The goal is to create a reliable backend system that ensures seamless communication, real-time updates, and effective ride management.

**Project Goal**:  
To develop a scalable backend system for a ride-sharing application that allows users to book rides, manage requests, and facilitate real-time tracking.

**Backend Features**:

- **User Authentication**:
  - Implement secure authentication protocols for riders, drivers, and administrators, ensuring role-based access control (RBAC) for proper permissions and data security.

- **Ride Request & Management**:
  - Develop APIs for riders to submit ride requests, specifying pickup and drop-off locations.
  - Create functionalities for drivers to accept, decline, or manage ride requests efficiently.
  - Implement an algorithm to match riders with the nearest available drivers based on real-time location data.

- **Integration with 3rd-party APIs**:
  - Integrate with the Mapbox API for route planning, real-time tracking, and geolocation services.
  - Utilize the API to calculate estimated fares based on distance and expected travel time.

- **Data Visualization**:
  - Design APIs to provide charts and graphs displaying ride trends, driver performance metrics, and earnings over time.
  - Implement analytics to track user engagement and service performance.

- **Search & Filter**:
  - Create functionalities for riders to search for available rides based on destination, driver ratings, or estimated time of arrival.
  - Develop filters for drivers to view ride requests by location, rider rating, or distance.

- **Real-time Updates**:
  - Implement a real-time notification system to keep riders and drivers informed about ride statuses, cancellations, or updates.
  - Utilize WebSocket or polling mechanisms to ensure instant updates on ride tracking and status changes.

- **Export Ride History**:
  - Allow users to export their ride history in CSV or PDF formats for personal records or expense tracking.
  - Develop backend endpoints to generate and serve these reports dynamically.

- **API Testing and Documentation**:
  - Conduct thorough testing of all API endpoints related to ride requests, driver management, and fare calculations to ensure performance and reliability.
  - Provide comprehensive API documentation, including endpoint specifications, request/response examples, and error handling guidelines.

- **Driver Ratings & Reviews**:
  - Implement a system for riders to rate and review drivers post-ride, allowing for performance feedback and quality assurance.
  - Create APIs to manage and retrieve driver ratings and reviews for analysis.

- **Fare Calculation**:
  - Develop algorithms for fare estimation based on various factors, including distance, duration, and surge pricing during peak times.
  - Create endpoints to handle fare calculations and provide riders with transparent pricing.
