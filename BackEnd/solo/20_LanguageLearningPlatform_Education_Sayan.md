### **Language Learning Platform**

**Context**:  
Emily, a passionate language teacher, recognized the limitations of traditional language learning methods and sought to create an interactive platform to enhance student engagement and effectiveness. Her vision was to develop a comprehensive language learning platform that would allow users to participate in lessons, complete exercises, and track their progress in a user-friendly environment. This platform would empower teachers to create and manage lessons while providing students access to diverse multimedia content to enrich their learning experiences.

**Objective**:  
The project aims to build a scalable and interactive language learning platform that facilitates lesson creation, practice exercises, and progress tracking for both learners and educators.

### **Key Features**

- **User Authentication & Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:  
  - Implement secure user authentication using protocols like OAuth2, allowing users to sign up, log in, and manage their accounts.
  - Define distinct user roles (e.g., learners, teachers) with specific permissions to create, access, and modify content on the platform, ensuring appropriate access levels for all users.

- **Lesson Creation & Management API**:  
  - Develop a RESTful API that enables teachers to create, edit, and manage lessons enriched with multimedia content (text, audio, video).
  - Allow teachers to categorize lessons by language and difficulty level, enhancing discoverability and organization for students.

- **Integration with Third-Party APIs**:  
  - Integrate the **LibreTranslate API** to provide real-time translation assistance within lessons, facilitating practical language translation exercises for students.
  - Utilize external language resources through APIs, such as dictionaries and pronunciation guides, to support studentsâ€™ learning processes.

- **Data Visualization of Learning Progress**:  
  - Implement data visualization tools to display user learning metrics, including progress over time, quiz scores, and study streaks using interactive charts and graphs.
  - Enable educators to access performance analytics for each student, allowing for tailored teaching approaches based on individual learning patterns.

- **Search & Filter Functionality**:  
  - Provide an API endpoint that allows students to search for lessons based on criteria such as language, difficulty level, or teacher, improving the efficiency of content discovery.
  - Include advanced filtering options to help students quickly locate relevant lessons and exercises.

- **File Uploads for Lesson Materials**:  
  - Enable teachers to securely upload lesson materials (e.g., audio files, PDF documents) directly into the lesson management system, enhancing lesson interactivity and resource availability.
  - Implement a secure storage solution for uploaded files, ensuring easy retrieval during lessons while maintaining data integrity and confidentiality.

- **Export Learning Data**:  
  - Create an API endpoint that allows users to export their progress reports and lesson completion data as PDF documents for personal records or to share with educators.
  - Include customizable options to specify the date range and types of data included in the export, ensuring relevance and usability.

- **API Testing & Documentation**:  
  - Conduct thorough testing of all API endpoints to ensure proper functionality for lesson creation, user progress tracking, and exercise completion, maintaining high reliability.
  - Provide comprehensive API documentation detailing usage instructions, authentication methods, request/response formats, and practical examples to assist developers in integrating and utilizing the platform effectively.

- **Quiz and Exercise Management**:  
  - Develop APIs that allow teachers to create, assign, and evaluate quizzes and exercises in various formats (multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank), providing diverse assessment methods.
  - Enable students to complete quizzes and track their scores and feedback in real-time, facilitating immediate learning reinforcement.

- **Discussion Forum Integration**:  
  - Implement a discussion forum where students can ask questions and engage with teachers and peers on lessons and language learning topics, fostering a collaborative learning environment.
  - Provide APIs for posting, commenting, and moderating discussions within the platform, ensuring a constructive and respectful community space.
