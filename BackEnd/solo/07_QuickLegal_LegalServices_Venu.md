### **QuickLegal_LegalServices**

**Storyline:**  
QuickLegal is a platform designed to offer users easy access to legal services, including booking consultations with Advocates and accessing legal document templates. The platform aims to democratize legal support, making it more accessible for individuals seeking basic legal guidance.

---

### **Project Goal:**

The goal is to develop a backend for a legal service platform that provides users with a seamless way to search for Advocates, book consultations, and generate legal documents.

---

### **Minimum Expected Features:**

1. **User Authentication:**

   - JWT-based user registration and login system to secure user data and allow personalized access.

2. **Advocate Search API:**

   - Users can search for Advocates based on expertise (e.g., family law, business law, criminal law). Each Advocate profile will display relevant details such as availability and consultation fees.

3. **Booking System API:**

   - Implement an appointment booking system that allows users to schedule consultations with Advocates. The system should manage availability and notify users of confirmed bookings.

4. **Document Service:**

   - Provide a service for generating customizable legal document templates (e.g., contracts, wills, agreements). Users can download and personalize these templates.

5. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**

   - Role-based authorization for different types of users (regular users, Advocates, and admins), controlling access to certain services (e.g., only Advocates can update their profiles, only admins can manage accounts).

6. **Payment Integration API:**

   - Integrate a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe or PayPal) to process consultation fees securely.

7. **MongoDB Integration:**

   - Use MongoDB to manage and store data, including user profiles, Advocate profiles, booking information, legal documents, and payment records.

8. **API Testing:**
   - Write unit and integration tests for all APIs using Mocha or Jest, ensuring the application is reliable and free of critical bugs.

### **Unique Feature:**

1. **Initial Law Consultation with Case Matching Algorithm:**
   - When a user registers a legal case, an algorithm will analyze the details of the case and search for similar cases that have been registered within the system. The user will be shown previous outcomes or consultations related to these similar cases, providing them with a more informed starting point for their legal process. This feature helps users better understand their situation by leveraging historical data.

---

### **Challenging Features:**

1. **Complex Data Representation for Legal Metrics:**

   - Provide admins with data visualizations that show platform statistics, such as the number of consultations per week, Advocate availability trends, and the most popular legal services. This involves generating reports with complex filters.

2. **Document Service Enhancements:**
   - Allow users to store and manage generated legal documents in the cloud, enabling them to access these documents from any device. Secure storage with encryption should be implemented for sensitive legal data.
