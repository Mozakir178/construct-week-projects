### **CRM System**

**Context**:  
Jason, a sales manager at a fast-growing tech startup, struggled to track leads, manage customer interactions, and monitor his team's sales performance efficiently. To streamline communication and improve productivity, he implemented a CRM system that not only organized leads and contacts but also provided valuable insights into the sales pipeline, helping the team optimize their efforts and increase conversions.

**Objective**:  
The project aims to build a comprehensive CRM platform that allows sales teams to effectively manage leads, contacts, and customer interactions. This system will empower teams to enhance customer relationships, improve sales performance, and drive business growth by providing clear insights and automated processes.

### **Key Features**

- **Authentication & Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:  
  - Implement secure user authentication using JWT or OAuth2, with role-based access control (RBAC) to manage different levels of access for sales representatives, managers, and administrators.
  - Allow administrators to assign roles and permissions, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access sensitive customer information and modify CRM settings.

- **Lead Management API**:  
  - Develop a RESTful API to handle lead management, including endpoints for creating, updating, and deleting leads. Capture detailed contact information, deal stage, and interaction history for each lead.
  - Enable sales representatives to log communications (emails, calls, meetings) with leads and set follow-up reminders to maintain consistent engagement.
  - Implement lead scoring functionality based on predefined criteria (e.g., engagement level, deal size) to help sales reps prioritize leads.

- **Email & SMS Integration**:  
  - Integrate with popular email services like Gmail and Outlook, enabling automatic logging of emails and attachments to the corresponding lead or contact records.
  - Leverage services like [Twilio API](https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/api) to enable SMS communication tracking, allowing sales reps to send and record text messages directly from the CRM.
  - Provide an aggregated communication history, giving sales reps a unified view of all interactions with each lead or customer.

- **Sales Performance & Pipeline Visualization**:  
  - Build a data visualization dashboard to display key metrics such as lead conversion rates, sales pipeline stages, and team performance through charts, graphs, and progress indicators.
  - Offer sales managers insights into team performance, enabling them to track goals, assess strengths and weaknesses, and identify areas for improvement.
  - Provide drill-down functionality to view performance at the individual sales rep level, including total deals closed, average deal size, and communication frequency.

- **Advanced Search & Filtering**:  
  - Implement advanced search and filtering options, allowing users to search for leads and contacts based on criteria like status, geographic location, industry, or deal value.
  - Provide sorting capabilities to prioritize leads by factors such as deal stage, lead score, or follow-up urgency.
  - Support bulk actions for efficiently managing large volumes of leads, such as updating statuses, assigning leads to team members, or sending mass emails.

- **Document Management & File Uploads**:  
  - Allow users to upload and attach relevant documents (e.g., proposals, contracts, presentations) to leads, deals, or contacts for easy access and organization.
  - Create a secure file management system that supports version control and ensures compliance with data privacy regulations, such as GDPR or CCPA.
  - Enable document sharing among team members, allowing collaborative work on deals while maintaining an organized and centralized document repository.

- **Report Export & Customization**:  
  - Implement functionality that allows users to export sales reports and lead data in various formats (PDF, Excel, CSV), helping sales teams analyze performance and prepare for presentations or meetings.
  - Provide customizable report templates that users can tailor to focus on specific metrics, such as sales growth by region, deal size by industry, or individual sales rep performance.
  - Allow users to schedule regular report exports, delivering insights via email at set intervals (daily, weekly, monthly).

- **API Testing & Documentation**:  
  - Perform automated testing for all API endpoints to ensure functionality, accuracy, and security, especially in critical areas such as lead management, communication logging, and RBAC.
  - Develop and maintain thorough API documentation, including usage examples, endpoint details, request/response structures, and error handling guidelines, to assist developers in integrating the CRM system with external tools.

- **User Feedback & Lead Scoring Improvement**:  
  - Build a feedback mechanism where sales reps can rate the quality of leads based on their interactions and provide detailed insights into customer needs and behavior.
  - Use this feedback to enhance lead scoring algorithms, ensuring the most valuable leads are prioritized for follow-up.
  - Aggregate feedback data to refine sales strategies and improve the overall lead qualification process, driving better sales outcomes.
