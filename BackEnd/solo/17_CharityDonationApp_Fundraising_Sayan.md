### **Charity Donation Platform**

**Context**:  
Many individuals, like Emily, desire to support various charitable causes but often face challenges in finding a reliable platform that not only facilitates donations but also provides transparency, impact reporting, and ease of tracking donation history. This Charity Donation Platform addresses these needs by offering a seamless way for users to donate to multiple verified charities, track their contributions, and receive insights into the impact of their donations.

**Objective**:  
The goal of this project is to create a secure, user-friendly platform that connects donors with charitable organizations. Users will be able to donate to their favorite causes, view their donation history, and track the real-world impact of their contributions. Additionally, charities will have tools to manage their profiles, showcase their projects, and engage with donors.

  - Offer advanced filtering options for users to narrow down charities based on geographic location, project type, or user ratings.
  - Integrate with external charity databases or APIs to ensure accurate and up-to-date information on organizations listed on the platform.

- **Data Visualization for Donation Impact**:  
  - Build a dashboard with data visualization tools that display users' donation trends, showing total contributions over time, preferred causes, and top charities supported.

  - For administrators, offer an analytics dashboard that displays top donors, popular charities, and donation growth patterns across different time periods.

- **File Uploads for Charities**:  
  - Allow charities to upload documents related to their projects, funding goals, and impact reports (e.g., PDFs, images).
  - Create an API for securely managing document uploads with validation checks to ensure the authenticity of uploaded files.

  - Create a public impact feed, allowing donors to see how their contributions are making a difference across various causes.

- **API Testing & Documentation**:  
  - Implement automated testing for all API endpoints to ensure smooth functionality, especially in areas such as donation processing, user profile management, and charity updates.
  - Provide comprehensive API documentation that includes details on usage, authentication, input/output structures, and error handling.
