### **ImageHub_Entertainment**

**Storyline:**  
ImageHub is a platform where users can manage, organize, and share their personal images with flexibility in privacy controls. Users can categorize their images, set them as public or private, and securely share private images with others. The system also provides personalized image recommendations based on the user’s stated interests, fostering a community for shared visual content.

**Project Goal:**  
To develop a backend system for an image management platform where users can securely store, categorize, and share images, with advanced privacy and personalization features.

**Minimum Expected Features:**

1. **User Authentication:**

   - Implement secure user registration and login using JWT for authentication and authorization.

2. **Image Upload API:**

   - Create an API for users to upload images with metadata (title, description, categories) and classify them as either public or private.

3. **Categorization System:**

   - Build a system for categorizing images into different user-defined categories (e.g., travel, family, work).

4. **Privacy Control API:**

   - Allow users to set images as public or private, ensuring that private images are only accessible through secure sharing links.

5. **User Profile Creation API:**

   - Develop a user profile system where users can define their interests (e.g., nature, art, photography styles) and manage personal information.

6. **Public Gallery API:**

   - Build an API for browsing public images, filtered based on user-defined categories and interests.

7. **MongoDB Integration:**

   - Use MongoDB to store user profiles, images, categories, and sharing links with Mongoose schemas.

8. **API Testing:**
   - Write tests for all APIs using a testing framework like Mocha or Jest to ensure platform reliability.

**Unique Feature:**

1. **Interest-Based Public Image Recommendations:**
   - Implement a matchmaking algorithm that displays relevant public images based on a user’s interests. The system analyzes user profiles and recommends images that align with the categories they follow, creating a personalized browsing experience.

**Challenging Feature:**

1. **Secure Image Sharing:**
   - Develop a secure sharing mechanism where private images can be shared through temporary, encrypted links. Users can generate a link with customizable expiration dates and access limits, ensuring that only intended recipients can view the content.

**Additional Features:**

- **Favorites and Bookmarks:**
  - Allow users to mark images as favorites and save them for quick access later.

---

**Optional Features:**

- **AI-Driven Image Tagging:**

  - Integrate AI to automatically tag uploaded images based on their content, simplifying categorization for users.

- **Cloud Storage Integration:**
  - Offer cloud storage solutions to allow users to store high-resolution images securely.
