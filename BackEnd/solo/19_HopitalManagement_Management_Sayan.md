### **Hospital Management System**

**Context**:  
Dr. Sarah, an experienced physician at a local hospital, encountered significant challenges in efficiently managing patient data, appointments, and medical records as patient numbers surged. She identified the need for a comprehensive hospital management platform that would streamline operations, enhance patient care, and ensure secure access to vital medical information. The proposed system aimed to centralize patient records and appointment scheduling, improving interaction between healthcare professionals and patients.

**Objective**:  
The project aims to develop a robust hospital management system that effectively manages patient data, appointment scheduling, and medical records while ensuring compliance with healthcare regulations and enhancing overall patient care.

### **Key Features**

- **User Authentication & Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:  
  - Implement secure user authentication using standards such as JWT or OAuth2, with role-based access control to manage different user types (doctors, nurses, patients, administrators).
  - Assign specific permissions for each role, ensuring authorized access to patient data and functionalities while maintaining confidentiality and compliance with regulations like HIPAA.

- **Patient Record Management API**:  
  - Develop a RESTful API that enables doctors to create, update, and manage comprehensive patient records, including medical history, diagnoses, treatment plans, and medications.
  - Provide patients with secure access to view their medical records and history through a dedicated patient portal, enhancing transparency and engagement in their healthcare.

- **Integration with Third-Party APIs**:  
  - Integrate with the **Google Fit API** to retrieve patient health data, such as activity levels, heart rate, and vitals, providing a holistic view of each patient's health status.
  - Utilize lab system APIs to automate the retrieval and updating of test results in patient records, ensuring timely access to critical health information.

- **Data Visualization Tools**:  
  - Implement data visualization dashboards to present key metrics, including patient visit statistics, medication adherence, and recovery trends, using interactive charts and graphs.
  - Enable healthcare professionals to gain insights into treatment effectiveness, identify areas needing intervention, and make data-driven decisions to enhance patient outcomes.

- **Advanced Search & Filter Functionality**:  
  - Provide advanced search capabilities for patient records based on criteria such as name, medical condition, or assigned doctor, improving efficiency in locating relevant data.
  - Include sorting features to prioritize records based on urgency, treatment dates, or other relevant factors, aiding in timely decision-making.

- **File Uploads for Medical Documentation**:  
  - Allow authorized personnel to securely upload medical documentation, including test results, medical reports, and imaging studies directly to patient records, ensuring comprehensive documentation.
  - Implement a secure storage solution that guarantees the integrity, confidentiality, and compliance of uploaded files, adhering to data protection regulations.

- **Export Medical History**:  
  - Enable patients to export their complete medical history as a PDF document for personal records or to share with other healthcare providers, facilitating continuity of care.
  - Offer customizable export options, allowing patients to specify which records or data fields to include, ensuring relevance and clarity in shared information.

- **API Testing & Documentation**:  
  - Conduct rigorous testing of all API endpoints to ensure secure handling of patient data, robust access controls, and compliance with healthcare regulations.
  - Provide comprehensive API documentation, including usage examples, authentication methods, error handling procedures, and best practices for secure data access to support developers in integration efforts.

- **Appointment Scheduling System**:  
  - Develop an appointment scheduling feature that allows patients to book appointments with doctors based on their availability, complete with notifications and reminders for both parties.
  - Enable doctors to manage their schedules, view upcoming appointments, and update appointment statuses, enhancing workflow efficiency within the healthcare team.

- **Patient Feedback Mechanism**:  
  - Integrate a feedback system that allows patients to rate their healthcare experiences and provide comments on services received, fostering continuous improvement.
  - Utilize feedback data to enhance service delivery, address patient concerns, and implement initiatives aimed at improving patient satisfaction and engagement.
