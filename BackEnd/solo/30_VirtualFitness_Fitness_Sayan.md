### **Virtual Fitness Trainer**

**Context**:  
The growing popularity of fitness apps and virtual training platforms allows users to conveniently track their workouts and progress, providing them with customized workout recommendations and fitness insights. A virtual fitness platform bridges the gap between professional trainers and trainees, allowing users to follow structured workout plans, receive personalized advice, and track their fitness journey.

**Objective**:  
The goal of this project is to create a **Virtual Fitness Trainer** platform where users (trainees) can follow workout plans designed by trainers, log their fitness activities, and track their progress. Trainers will be able to create and manage workout plans, monitor user progress, and provide personalized feedback. The platform will integrate external APIs for workout data and use data visualization to offer users insights into their progress.

### **Key Features**

- **User Authentication & Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:  
  - Implement a secure login system for two user roles: Trainers and Trainees.
  - Trainers can create and assign workout plans, track user progress, and provide recommendations. Trainees can follow workout plans, log exercises, and view their fitness stats.

- **Workout Plan Management & Progress Tracking**:  
  - Trainers can create, edit, and assign workout plans based on user goals (e.g., strength, weight loss, endurance).
  - Trainees can log completed exercises, track calories burned, and input additional data (e.g., weights lifted, distance run, etc.) to monitor their progress.

- **Personalized Recommendations**:  
  - Based on logged workouts and progress, the system can recommend personalized workouts to trainees (e.g., adjust difficulty, suggest exercises based on target body parts or goals).

- **3rd-Party API Integration**:  
  - **ExerciseDB API**: Use this API to access detailed workout and exercise information, such as exercises targeting specific muscle groups, requiring certain equipment, or having particular difficulty levels.

- **Data Visualization**:  
  - Display workout stats through graphs, such as calories burned, weight loss progress, workout intensity trends, or total time spent exercising over a specified period.
  - Visualize comparisons between planned vs. completed workouts for tracking adherence.

- **Search & Filter Workouts**:  
  - Allow users to search for workouts by body part (e.g., legs, arms), equipment (e.g., dumbbells, resistance bands), or difficulty (e.g., beginner, advanced).
  - Filtering workouts by these parameters can help users find exercises suitable for their needs.

- **File Uploads**:  
  - Allow users to upload workout-related media, such as videos of their exercises, progress pictures, or screenshots of fitness accomplishments.
  - Trainers can review these uploads to give feedback or approve technique improvements.

- **Notifications & Alerts**:  
  - Send notifications to trainees about upcoming workout plans, goals achieved, or reminders for missed workouts.
  - Trainers can be notified of traineesâ€™ progress updates or messages.

- **Export Workout Data**:  
  - Users can export summaries of their workouts (e.g., workout plans, logged exercises, calories burned) as a PDF for personal records or sharing with trainers.
  - Allow trainers to export workout plans or user progress summaries.

- **Goal Setting & Achievement Tracking**:  
  - Users can set fitness goals (e.g., weight loss, muscle gain, running distance) and track their progress toward these goals through the platform.
  - Provide visual feedback when milestones are reached (e.g., goals achieved or personal records).

- **API Testing & Validation**:  
  - Test API endpoints for workout plan creation, progress tracking, and recommendations.
  - Ensure validation for user data input and proper handling of workout logging requests to avoid errors or duplicate entries.
