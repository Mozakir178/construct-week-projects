### **TalentPool_CommunityEngagement**

**Storyline:**  
TalentPool is a community-based platform where individuals can showcase their skills and talents for job opportunities, collaborations, or volunteering. Users can create profiles, post projects, and engage with others in skill-based events or collaborative efforts.

---

### **Project Goal:**

The goal is to develop a backend system that allows users to showcase their skills, find relevant projects, and collaborate with others within the community.

---

### **Minimum Expected Features:**

1. **User Authentication:**

   - Implement JWT-based user registration and login to securely authenticate users.

2. **Profile Management API:**

   - Users can create and update their profiles, listing skills, portfolios, and other relevant information for potential collaborators and project owners to view.

3. **Community Projects API:**

   - API for users to post and manage community projects or gigs, specifying required skills, project descriptions, and deadlines.

4. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**

   - RBAC system for different user roles: regular users (who can join projects), project owners (who can create and manage projects), and admins (who can moderate activities).

5. **Collaboration Service API:**

   - Provide an API that enables users to send messages and collaborate within the platform on projects, helping teams communicate efficiently.

6. **MongoDB Integration:**

   - Use MongoDB to store essential data such as user profiles, skills, project postings, collaborations, and messages.

7. **API Testing:**

   - Write comprehensive tests for all APIs using Mocha or Jest to ensure their proper functioning.

8. **Search and Filter Functionality:**
   - Enable users to search for specific projects or collaborators based on skills, availability, and location to easily connect with the right opportunities.

### **Unique Features:**

1. **Project Matching Algorithm:**
   - Develop a project matching algorithm that automatically suggests projects to users based on their listed skills, interests, and past project engagements. This algorithm will help users find relevant opportunities more efficiently by scanning project requirements and matching them with user profiles.
2. **Waitlist for Project Collaboration:**
   - If the desired number of collaborators for a project is full, users can be placed on a waitlist. If any collaborators withdraw from the project, users from the waitlist will be added automatically, or the project owner will be notified. This applies to both skill-based and volunteering projects.

### **Challenging Features:**

1. **Complex Data Visualization for Engagement Insights:**

   - Implement complex data visualization for admins and users to track engagement over time. Visuals such as graphs showing the number of projects joined, skills added, and collaborations formed will provide detailed insights into user activity.

2. **Ratings and Feedback API:**

   - Users can rate collaborators based on performance and provide feedback after project completion, which will be factored into their profiles. This system will require detailed backend management to handle ratings and reviews.

3. **Real-Time Messaging Service:**
   - Implement real-time messaging between collaborators using WebSockets, ensuring that users can communicate seamlessly while working on projects together.
