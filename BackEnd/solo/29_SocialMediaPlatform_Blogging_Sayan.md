### **Social Media Platform with Content Moderation**

**Context**:  
Social media platforms are essential for sharing information and connecting people. However, managing user-generated content and ensuring a safe and respectful environment is crucial. A social media platform with integrated content moderation mechanisms allows users to create and engage with posts while ensuring the community guidelines are upheld through moderation techniques.

**Objective**:  
The goal of this project is to build a **Social Media Platform** where users can post content, interact with others through likes, comments, and shares, and follow their favorite users. The platform will include automated and manual content moderation to ensure appropriate behavior, along with data visualization for tracking user activity and flagged content.

### **Key Features**

- **User Authentication & Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:  
  - Implement a secure login system with roles for Admins, Moderators, and Users.
  - Admins oversee platform activities, manage users, and view analytics. Moderators review flagged content, while Users create and engage with posts.

- **Post Creation & Interaction**:  
  - Users can create posts with text, images, and videos.
  - Implement interaction features like likes, comments, and sharing functionality for posts.

- **Content Moderation**:  
  - Use AI-based content moderation to automatically detect inappropriate content.
  - Flagged content can be manually reviewed by moderators for final decisions.
  - Integration with content moderation APIs for detecting offensive or harmful materials (e.g., text, images, or videos).

- **3rd-Party API Integration**:  
  - **Content Moderation**: Use **Google Cloud Vision API** (or similar) to moderate uploaded images and videos for inappropriate content.
  
- **Data Visualization**:  
  - Admins and moderators can access dashboards displaying key statistics like user activity, post engagement, flagged content trends, and moderation decisions.
  - Visualize metrics like the most active users, most commented posts, and moderation statistics.

- **Search & Filter**:  
  - Allow users to search posts by keywords, hashtags, or users.
  - Filter posts based on popularity (likes, comments), time (recent, trending), or flagged status (for moderators).

- **File Uploads**:  
  - Users can upload images, videos, and documents along with their posts.
  - Ensure uploaded content adheres to platform rules, utilizing content moderation where necessary.

- **Export User Data**:  
  - Allow users to export their post history, likes, comments, and interactions in PDF or CSV format for personal tracking.

- **Notifications & Alerts**:  
  - Send real-time notifications to users for post interactions (likes, comments, follows).
  - Notify users when their content is flagged for moderation and inform them about the moderation outcome.

- **Reporting & Insights for Admins**:  
  - Admins can generate reports summarizing platform usage, engagement, and moderation statistics.
  - Export user activity and engagement data as PDF or CSV for analysis and reporting.

- **API Testing & Validation**:  
  - Test API endpoints for post creation, content moderation, and user interactions.
  - Ensure secure handling of requests, validation for file uploads, and appropriate moderation of content.
