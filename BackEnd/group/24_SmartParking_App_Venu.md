### **SmartParking_System**

**Storyline:**  
SmartParking is an innovative platform designed to optimize parking space utilization in urban areas. It connects drivers with available parking spots in real-time, reducing the time spent searching for parking and enhancing the overall parking experience.

**Project Goal:**  
To develop a robust backend for the SmartParking platform, providing APIs for parking space management, user authentication, notifications, and payment processing.

**Minimum Expected Features:**

1. **User Authentication:**
   - Implement user registration and login functionalities using JWT for secure authentication and authorization.

2. **Parking Space API:**
   - Create an API to list available parking spaces, including location, capacity, and availability status.

3. **Booking API:**
   - Develop an API that allows users to book parking spaces in advance, with options to cancel or modify bookings.

4. **Payment Processing API:**
   - Integrate a payment processing system to handle payments for booked parking spaces, including transaction history tracking.

5. **Stimulation for Location Updates:**
   - Implement a feature that allows parking space owners (drivers) to update their location and availability status in real-time, ensuring accurate data for users.

6. **MongoDB Integration:**
   - Use MongoDB to store user profiles, parking space details, booking information, and transaction history.

7. **API Testing:**
   - Write tests for all APIs using a testing framework like Mocha or Jest to ensure functionality and reliability.

**Unique Features:**

1. **Location-Based Notifications:**
   - Send notifications to users when parking spaces become available near their location, enabling them to secure a spot quickly.

2. **Dynamic Pricing Model:**
   - Implement a dynamic pricing algorithm that adjusts parking fees based on demand and availability, providing incentives for users to book during off-peak hours.

3. **Referral Program:**
   - Create a referral system where users can share unique links to invite others. If a referred user books a parking space, both users receive discounts. The referral link expires once redeemed.

**Challenging Features:**

1. **Data Analytics Dashboard:**
   - Build an analytics dashboard that provides insights into parking usage patterns, peak times, and revenue generation for parking space owners.

2. **AI-Based Parking Recommendations:**
   - Implement an AI algorithm that recommends the best parking spaces for users based on their historical booking data and preferences.
