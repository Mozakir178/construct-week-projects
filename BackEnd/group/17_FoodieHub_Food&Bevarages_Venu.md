## **FoodieHub_App**

### **Storyline:**

FoodieHub is a food and beverage management platform designed to connect restaurants, customers, and food enthusiasts. It allows users to discover restaurants, manage reservations, order food online, and engage with culinary content.

### **Project Goal:**

To develop a robust backend for the FoodieHub platform, providing APIs for restaurant management, user accounts, online orders, and recipe sharing.

### **Minimum Expected Features:**

1. **User Authentication:**

   - Implement user registration and login functionalities using JWT for secure authentication and authorization.
   - Role-based access control (RBAC) for differentiating between customers, restaurant owners, and admins.

2. **Restaurant Management API:**

   - Create an API for restaurant owners to manage their profiles, including details like name, address, menu items, and operating hours.
   - Endpoint for customers to view restaurant details.

3. **Menu Management API:**

   - Develop an API for restaurants to add, update, and remove menu items, including descriptions, prices, and availability.

4. **Order Management API:**

   - Build an API to allow customers to place online orders, including options for delivery or pickup.
   - Endpoint for tracking order status and history.

5. **Reservation Management API:**

   - Create an API for customers to make reservations at restaurants, including time slots and party size.
   - Endpoint for restaurant owners to manage reservations.

6. **MongoDB Integration:**

   - Use MongoDB to store user profiles, restaurant details, menu items, orders, and reservation data.

7. **API Testing:**

   - Write tests for all APIs using a testing framework like Mocha or Jest to ensure functionality and reliability.

8. **Customer Support API:**
   - Create an API for customer support, allowing users to submit inquiries and receive assistance via chat or email.

### **Unique Features:**

1. **Recipe Sharing Platform:**

   - Implement a feature allowing users to share their own recipes, with APIs for uploading, editing, and deleting recipes.

2. **Rating and Review System:**

   - Develop an API that enables users to rate and review restaurants and menu items, enhancing user engagement and restaurant visibility.

3. **Promotions and Discounts API:**

   - **Referral Discounts:**

     - When a user shares a restaurant link with friends or on social media, the shared link will include a unique referral code.
     - If a new customer clicks on the link and places their first order at the restaurant, both the referrer and the new customer will receive a discount (e.g., 10% off their next order).
     - The referral link will have an expiration time (e.g., 30 days) and can only be redeemed once by the referred customer.

   - **Loyalty Discounts for Regular Customers:**

     - Implement a system that tracks user order history. Based on the total amount spent or frequency of orders, customers can automatically qualify for tiered discounts on their next purchases (e.g., 5% off after 5 orders, 10% off after 10 orders).
     - The system will automatically apply discounts at checkout based on their loyalty tier, and users will receive notifications about their progress towards the next discount tier.

   - **Time-Limited Promotions:**

     - Restaurants can create special time-limited promotions (e.g., "Happy Hour" discounts or "Weekend Specials") that customers can access through the app.
     - Users will receive notifications for these promotions, encouraging them to take advantage of the offers during the specified timeframe.

   - **Custom Discount Codes:**

     - Allow restaurants to generate custom discount codes for special occasions (e.g., birthdays, anniversaries) that customers can redeem during checkout.
     - Implement a validation mechanism to ensure codes are used within their validity period and to prevent misuse.

   - **Promotional Analytics Dashboard:**
     - Provide restaurant owners with analytics on the effectiveness of their promotional campaigns, including metrics on how many users clicked on their referral links, redeemed discounts, and overall sales increase during promotion periods.
