### **AI-Powered Product Recommendation System**

**Context:**  
In e-commerce, personalized recommendations can significantly improve user experience and drive sales. This project focuses on developing a recommendation system backend that suggests products based on user interactions, filtering, and product attributes. Without using machine learning, the system will rely on rule-based algorithms and heuristics to offer real-time, personalized product suggestions.

**Project Goal:**  
To build a scalable and efficient backend system for providing personalized product recommendations using rule-based approaches, improving user engagement and increasing sales.

### **Core Backend Features**

#### 1. **Data Ingestion and Storage**

- **User Interaction Data**:  
     Set up pipelines to collect and store data on user actions like product views, searches, and purchases in a database.
- **Product Catalog Data**:  
     Maintain up-to-date product information, including pricing, categories, and availability in the system.
- **Scalable Data Storage**:  
     Use databases like **PostgreSQL**, **MongoDB**, or **MySQL** for efficiently storing and querying product and user interaction data.

#### 2. **Rule-Based Recommendation Engine**

- **Basic Filtering**:  
     Recommend products based on predefined filters, such as price range, category, and customer ratings.
- **Similar Products Based on Attributes**:  
     Suggest similar products by comparing attributes like brand, category, and product specifications. For example, recommend shoes from the same brand or similar price range.
- **Purchase History-Based Suggestions**:  
     Recommend products to users based on their past purchase history. For instance, if a user bought running shoes, suggest accessories like socks or sports gear.
- **Trending Products**:  
     Suggest products that are currently popular or trending based on recent sales or view counts.
- **Recently Viewed Products**:  
     Show users products they have recently interacted with, encouraging re-engagement.

#### 2. **Recommendation Engine**  

- **Collaborative Filtering**:  
     Implement collaborative filtering techniques that suggest products based on user similarity or group behavior, such as "users who bought X also bought Y."
- **Content-Based Recommendations**:  
     Recommend products based on attributes of items previously interacted with by the user, such as brand, category, and specifications.
- **Real-Time Personalization**:  
     Provide real-time personalized recommendations by dynamically adjusting to user interactions during the session, such as product views and cart additions.

#### 3. **Cross-Selling and Up-Selling**

- **Complementary Products**:  
     Recommend products related to those already in the user’s cart or purchase history, such as accessories or complementary items (e.g., a phone case for a smartphone).
- **Up-Sell Recommendations**:  
     Suggest higher-end alternatives to products the user is viewing or has in their cart, promoting upgrades or bundles.

#### 4. **Filtering and Sorting**

- **Advanced Filters**:  
     Allow filtering of product recommendations by multiple parameters like price, category, availability, and user ratings.
- **Sorting Options**:  
     Implement sorting logic, such as "most popular," "highest-rated," or "price: low to high," to display products in a preferred order.

#### 5. **Real-Time Personalization**

- **Session-Based Personalization**:  
     Adjust recommendations dynamically during the user’s session based on ongoing interactions like product views or cart additions.
- **Browsing Behavior Tracking**:  
     Track the user’s browsing patterns (e.g., categories or product types frequently viewed) to refine the recommendations accordingly in real time.

#### 6. **Performance Monitoring and Analytics**

- **Recommendation Tracking**:  
     Track the effectiveness of recommendations by monitoring metrics such as **click-through rates** (CTR) and **conversion rates** for each recommendation strategy.
- **Analytics Dashboard**:  
     Provide an admin dashboard for tracking the performance of different recommendation strategies, user engagement, and sales growth from recommendations.
- **A/B Testing Support**:  
     Build the capability to run A/B tests on different recommendation algorithms, allowing the system to assess the impact of each strategy on sales and user behavior.

#### 7. **Scalability and High Availability**

- **Microservices Architecture**:  
     Design the recommendation engine as a set of microservices, enabling independent scaling and high availability during traffic spikes.
- **Caching**:  
     Implement caching with **Redis** or **Memcached** to store frequently used product recommendations, improving response times and reducing database load.
- **Load Balancing**:  
     Use load balancers to distribute traffic across multiple instances of the recommendation service, ensuring consistent performance during high demand.

#### 8. **API Development and Documentation**

- **RESTful APIs**:  
     Build a set of RESTful APIs to serve product recommendations in real-time, with endpoints for retrieving user-specific suggestions, cross-sell recommendations, and trending products.
- **Batch API Support**:  
     Implement batch processing APIs to handle large volumes of recommendation requests efficiently.
- **Comprehensive API Documentation**:  
     Provide detailed API documentation (using **Swagger** or **Postman**), outlining the available endpoints, authentication mechanisms, request/response formats, and error handling.

#### 9. **Security and Privacy**

- **Data Anonymization**:  
     Ensure all user data is anonymized to protect personal information and comply with regulations like **GDPR** and **CCPA**.
- **API Security**:  
     Secure API endpoints with **OAuth 2.0** and **JWT** for authentication and authorization.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:  
     Implement RBAC to control access to different parts of the system, ensuring only authorized users can query or modify sensitive data.

#### 10. **Logging and Error Handling**

- **Centralized Logging**:  
     Use tools like **ELK Stack** or **AWS CloudWatch** to log user interactions, recommendations served, and system errors for monitoring and troubleshooting.
- **Error Tracking and Alerts**:  
     Set up real-time alerts using tools like **Sentry** or **Datadog** to notify developers of issues in the recommendation engine.

### **Advanced Features**

#### 1. **Contextual Recommendations**

- **Location-Based Recommendations**:  
     Suggest products available for fast shipping based on the user’s geographic location.
- **Time-Based Recommendations**:  
     Provide seasonal or time-sensitive product recommendations based on the time of year or promotional events (e.g., holiday sales).

#### 2. **User Segmentation**

- **Segmentation-Based Recommendations**:  
     Create user segments (e.g., first-time buyers, frequent shoppers) and provide segment-specific product suggestions to boost engagement.
- **Special Offers for Segments**:  
     Develop APIs that deliver exclusive deals or recommendations for user segments, such as discounts for new users or loyal customers.

#### 3. **Inventory-Aware Recommendations**

- **Real-Time Stock Integration**:  
     Build an inventory-aware recommendation engine that only suggests products with sufficient stock or suggests alternatives for out-of-stock items.
