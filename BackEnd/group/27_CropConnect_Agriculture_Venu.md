### CropConnect_Agricultural Marketplace

**Storyline:**  
CropConnect is an agricultural marketplace designed to connect farmers directly with buyers, including consumers and businesses. This platform aims to streamline the supply chain, reduce food waste, and provide fresh produce to consumers at competitive prices.

**Project Goal:**  
To create a backend system for CropConnect that supports user registration, product listings, order management, and communication between farmers and buyers.

**Minimum Expected Features:**

1. **User Authentication:**

   - Implement secure registration and login functionalities for both farmers and buyers, using JWT for authentication.

2. **Product Listing API:**

   - Allow farmers to create and manage their product listings, including details like product name, description, quantity, price, and images.

3. **Order Management API:**

   - Develop an API for buyers to place orders, track their status, and manage order history.

4. **User Profile Management API:**

   - Enable users to create and update their profiles, including contact information and location.

5. **Search and Filter API:**

   - Implement an API that allows buyers to search for products based on categories, location, and keywords.

6. **Review and Rating System:**

   - Allow buyers to leave reviews and ratings for products and sellers, helping to build trust within the marketplace.

7. **MongoDB Integration:**

   - Utilize MongoDB to store user profiles, product listings, and order data.

8. **API Testing:**
   - Write tests for all APIs using a testing framework to ensure reliability and functionality.

**Unique Features:**

1. **Geo-Location-Based Product Discovery:**

   - Integrate a feature that uses geolocation to help buyers find local produce. When buyers enter the platform, they receive a list of nearby farmers and available products, enhancing convenience and supporting local agriculture. This feature can also provide insights into the distance and estimated delivery times for each product.

2. **Dynamic Pricing for Seasonal Products:**

   - Implement a dynamic pricing model that adjusts prices based on the seasonality and availability of products. For example, if a certain crop is in high supply during the harvest season, the price may decrease to encourage sales. Conversely, if a crop is scarce, prices may increase. This feature can help both farmers maximize profits and buyers find affordable options.

3. **Collaborative Purchasing for Bulk Orders:**

   - Allow buyers to team up for bulk purchases. For instance, a group of consumers can collectively order a large quantity of a particular product to qualify for discounts or reduced delivery fees. Once the bulk order is confirmed, the system notifies the farmer, who can prepare the order accordingly.

4. **Farmers' Market Event Promotion:**

   - Enable farmers to promote local farmers' market events on the platform. Farmers can create event listings, share details such as location, date, and time, and provide special offers for attendees. Buyers can RSVP for these events, and the platform can send reminders as the event date approaches.

5. **Sustainable Farming Practices Certification:**
   - Integrate a certification system that recognizes farmers who practice sustainable farming. Farmers can apply for this certification, which will be visible on their profiles, allowing buyers to support eco-friendly practices. This feature can also include educational resources on sustainable farming methods.

**Challenging Features:**

1. **AI-Powered Crop Recommendation System:**

   - Develop an AI algorithm that analyzes user preferences and purchasing patterns to recommend crops to buyers. This system will suggest seasonal products, highlighting new arrivals based on past orders, and will notify buyers when their preferred crops are available. This feature can enhance user engagement and encourage repeat purchases.

2. **User and Farmer Dashboards:**
   - Create comprehensive dashboards for both users and farmers to enhance user experience and data accessibility:
     - **User Dashboard:** Display personalized recommendations, order history, favorite products, and notifications about new arrivals or discounts. Users can manage their profiles and track their orders in real-time, making it easier to stay updated with their purchases.
     - **Farmer Dashboard:** Provide farmers with insights into their sales, product performance, and customer feedback. Farmers can manage their product listings, view order statuses, and analyze trends in their sales data to make informed decisions about their inventory and marketing strategies.

**Additional Features:**

- **Real-Time Chat System:**

  - Implement a chat system that allows buyers to communicate directly with farmers for inquiries about products or delivery options. This real-time communication can help clarify details and foster relationships between buyers and sellers.

- **Nutritional Information and Recipes:**
  - Provide nutritional information and recipe suggestions for each product listed on the platform. Buyers can learn more about the health benefits of their purchases and discover new ways to prepare the items they buy.
