## **LogisticsPro_Transport**

### **Storyline:**

LogisticsPro is a comprehensive logistics and transportation management platform designed to optimize fleet operations, enhance cargo tracking, and streamline delivery processes. This platform connects logistics companies, drivers, and customers, ensuring timely deliveries and efficient resource management.

### **Project Goal:**

To develop a robust backend for the LogisticsPro platform, providing APIs for fleet management, real-time cargo tracking, delivery optimization, and inventory management.

### **Minimum Expected Features:**

1. **User Authentication:**

   - Implement user registration and login functionalities using JWT for secure authentication and authorization.
   - Role-based access control (RBAC) to differentiate between admin, driver, and customer roles.

2. **Fleet Management API:**

   - Create an API for managing vehicle details, including tracking, maintenance schedules, and driver assignments.
   - Endpoint to update vehicle status (available, in transit, under maintenance).

3. **Cargo Tracking API:**

   - Develop an API to update and retrieve real-time cargo status, including location updates and estimated delivery times.
   - Endpoint for customers to view their cargoâ€™s current status.

4. **Delivery Route Optimization API:**

   - Build an API to calculate and return optimized delivery routes based on current traffic data and distance.
   - Integration with a third-party mapping service (e.g., Google Maps API) for real-time route calculations.

5. **Inventory Management API:**

   - Create an API for managing inventory levels, stock tracking, and order fulfillment status.
   - Endpoints for adding, updating, and removing inventory items.

6. **Order Management API:**

   - Develop APIs to create and manage customer orders, linking them with cargo and inventory.
   - Endpoints to track order status and history.

7. **MongoDB Integration:**

   - Use MongoDB to store user profiles, vehicle details, cargo information, delivery routes, and inventory data.

8. **API Testing:**

   - Write tests for all APIs using a testing framework like Mocha or Jest to ensure functionality and reliability.

9. **Customer Support API:**
   - Create an API for customer support, allowing users to submit inquiries and receive assistance via chat or email.

### **Unique Features:**

1. **Real-time Notifications:**

   - Implement a notification system that alerts users (drivers and customers) about important updates (e.g., cargo status, delivery estimates) via email or SMS.

2. **Analytics Dashboard:**

   - Develop an admin API to fetch analytics on fleet performance, delivery efficiency, and inventory status, providing insights for decision-making.
   - Visualize data with tools like Chart.js for an intuitive admin interface.

3. **Multi-language Support:**

   - Implement localization to support multiple languages, making the platform accessible to a broader audience.

4. **Document Upload and Management:**
   - Allow users to upload and manage necessary documents (e.g., shipping invoices, contracts) related to shipments and deliveries.

### **Challenging Features:**

1. **AI-based Route Optimization:**

   - Implement an AI algorithm that learns from historical data to suggest the most efficient routes, considering factors like traffic patterns and delivery times.

2. **Advanced Analytics with Data Visualization:**

   - Create an API that provides advanced analytics features, including data visualization for fleet performance metrics, using a library like Chart.js.

3. **Risk Assessment Tool:**

   - Develop a tool that evaluates potential risks for cargo based on historical data and user input, suggesting preventive measures.

4. **Geofencing Alerts:**
   - Implement geofencing functionality to send alerts when vehicles enter or exit predefined areas, enhancing security and tracking.

### **Additional Features:**

- **Driver Performance Monitoring:**

  - Implement features to track and assess driver performance based on delivery times, customer feedback, and safe driving practices.
  - Allow drivers to view their performance metrics through a dedicated API.

- **Customer Feedback System:**

  - Develop a system where customers can rate their delivery experience and provide feedback, which can be managed through an admin API.

- **Payment Processing Integration:**
  - Implement a secure payment processing API to handle payments for services and shipments, integrating with a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).

### **Optional Features:**

- **Referral Program API:**

  - Create an API to manage a referral program for customers, encouraging them to refer new clients in exchange for discounts or credits.

- **Mobile App Integration:**

  - Design APIs to support a mobile application, allowing drivers to access their routes and customers to track shipments on-the-go.

- **Frequent Questions (FAQ) API:**

  - Develop an API that provides answers to frequently asked questions, helping customers quickly find information.

- **Audit Log API:**
  - Implement an API that tracks changes made in the system for compliance and auditing purposes, ensuring transparency.
