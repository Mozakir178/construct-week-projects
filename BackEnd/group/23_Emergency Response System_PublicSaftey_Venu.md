### Emergency Response System

**Storyline:**  
The EmergencyResponse_System is a platform designed to enhance public safety by providing tools for reporting incidents, coordinating emergency responses, and ensuring timely notifications to relevant authorities and community members. The system aims to empower users to act swiftly in emergencies, while also fostering community engagement and awareness.

**Project Goal:**  
To develop a robust backend for the EmergencyResponse_System, providing APIs for incident reporting, emergency notifications, and community engagement.

**Minimum Expected Features:**

1. **User Authentication:**

   - Implement user registration and login functionalities using JWT for secure authentication and authorization.

2. **Incident Reporting API:**

   - Create an API that allows users to report emergencies or suspicious activities, capturing details like location, type of incident, and any relevant attachments (images or videos).

3. **Emergency Notification API:**

   - Develop an API to send real-time notifications to users and local authorities about reported incidents, including alerts for severe weather, accidents, and public safety threats.

4. **Community Engagement API:**

   - Implement an API for users to view ongoing incidents in their area, engage in community discussions, and share safety tips.

5. **Incident History API:**

   - Create an API to retrieve the history of reported incidents in a specified location, providing data for community awareness and safety analysis.

6. **User Roles and Permissions:**

   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to manage different user roles (general users, emergency responders, community moderators) and their access to specific functionalities.

7. **MongoDB Integration:**

   - Use MongoDB to store user profiles, incident reports, notifications, and community discussions.

8. **API Testing:**
   - Write tests for all APIs using a testing framework like Mocha or Jest to ensure functionality and reliability.

**Unique Features:**

1. **Incident Response Coordination:**

   - Develop an API that allows emergency responders to coordinate their efforts during an incident, enabling them to update statuses and share resources.

2. **Real-time Chat Feature:**

   - Implement a real-time chat feature for users to communicate during emergencies, facilitating faster sharing of information and support.

3. **Community Incident Reporting API:**

   - Allow users to report incidents in their community, which can be verified by moderators before being displayed publicly. Users who report verified incidents will receive rewards or recognition within the community.

4. **User Location Tracking:**

   - Implement a feature that allows users to share their location in case of emergencies, enabling quicker response times from emergency services.

5. **Safety Resource Library:**
   - Create an API that provides users with access to safety resources, such as emergency contact numbers, safety tips, and first aid guidelines.

**Challenging Features:**

1. **Predictive Analytics for Incident Trends:**

   - Implement a predictive analytics system that analyzes historical incident data to forecast potential safety threats or high-risk periods in specific areas.

2. **Machine Learning for Incident Classification:**

   - Use machine learning algorithms to classify incidents based on the reports submitted, helping to streamline emergency response efforts and resource allocation.

3. **Job Matching Algorithm for Emergency Services:**
   - Develop a job matching algorithm that connects available emergency responders with reported incidents based on proximity, expertise, and availability.
