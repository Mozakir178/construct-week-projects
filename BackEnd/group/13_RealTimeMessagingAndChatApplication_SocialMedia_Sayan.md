### **Real-Time Messaging & Chat Application**

**Context:**  
With the rise of digital communication, real-time messaging platforms have become essential for both personal and business use. This project aims to develop a scalable backend for a real-time messaging and chat application, supporting individual and group chats, media sharing, and secure messaging. The platform will offer enhanced user experiences with real-time updates, emoji reactions, and notifications.

**Project Goal:**  
Build a secure and efficient real-time chat system that allows users to communicate via text, share media, and engage in group chats, with additional features like typing indicators, message reactions, and encryption for privacy.

- **API Documentation**:  
  Provide clear and detailed API documentation using **Swagger** or **Postman**, with examples for each endpoint and response.

### 8. **Security and Privacy**

- **Data Encryption**:  
  Use strong encryption protocols (e.g., **TLS**, **AES-256**) to protect user data both at rest and in transit.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:  
  Implement role-based permissions to ensure that only authorized users can access or modify sensitive data.
- **GDPR and CCPA Compliance**:  
  Ensure the platform complies with privacy regulations by providing data management features like data export and deletion.

### 9. **Logging and Error Handling**

- **Centralized Logging**:  
  Use logging solutions like **ELK Stack** to monitor system events, errors, and user interactions.

#### 2. **Encryption and Security**

- **End-to-End Encryption**:  
  Secure messages using encryption protocols to ensure privacy, with decryption happening client-side.
- **Data Encryption API**:  
  Encrypt sensitive data such as messages and files, both in transit and at rest, using **SSL** and **AES** encryption.

#### 3. **Message Search and Archiving**

- **Search API**:  
  Implement a search functionality that allows users to search for messages or media within a conversation.
