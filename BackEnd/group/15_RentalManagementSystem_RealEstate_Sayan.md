### **Rental Management System**

**Context:**  
Managing rental properties can be time-consuming and complex for landlords and property managers. This project aims to build a web application that streamlines the rental management process by simplifying tenant applications, securing rent payments, and efficiently handling lease agreements.

**Project Goal:**  
Create a comprehensive rental management platform that allows landlords and property managers to handle tenant applications, process rent payments, and manage lease agreements, while providing additional features such as maintenance requests and tenant-landlord communication.

  Enable tenants to upload documents such as identification, proof of income, and references for further verification.

#### 2. **Rent Payment Processing**

- **Payment Gateway Integration**:  
  Integrate secure payment gateways (e.g., **Stripe**, **PayPal**) to process online rent payments via multiple methods such as credit/debit cards and bank transfers.
- **Automated Payment Reminders**:  
  Implement a system that sends automated reminders via email or SMS to tenants for upcoming rent due dates and overdue payments.
- **Transaction History API**:  
  Maintain a log of all rent payments made by tenants, providing both tenants and landlords with access to payment records and receipts.

#### 3. **Lease Management**

- **Lease Creation and Renewal API**:  
  Develop tools that allow landlords to create, manage, and renew lease agreements using customizable templates that comply with local regulations.
- **Digital Signatures**:  
  Enable secure, legally binding digital signatures for lease agreements to eliminate the need for paper contracts.

### **Scalability and Performance**

#### 1. **Microservices Architecture**

- **Service Separation**:  
  Design the platform using a microservices architecture, separating critical services such as tenant applications, rent processing, and lease management to allow for independent scaling and easy updates.

#### 2. **Caching with Redis**

- **Faster Data Access**:  
  Implement caching with **Redis** to store frequently accessed data such as tenant details, rent history, and active maintenance requests, ensuring faster access and improved performance.

#### 3. **Load Balancing**

- **Smooth Performance Under Load**:  
  Use load balancing across servers to ensure the system remains available and responsive, even during periods of high activity, such as at the end of the month when rent payments are processed.

### **Security and Compliance**

#### 1. **Data Encryption**

- **Encryption at Rest and in Transit**:  
  Ensure all sensitive tenant and landlord data is encrypted using **AES-256** for data at rest and **TLS** for data in transit, providing end-to-end security.

#### 2. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

- **User Permissions**:  
  Implement role-based permissions to restrict access to sensitive information such as payment records, lease agreements, and tenant applications based on the user's role (e.g., landlord, property manager, tenant).

#### 3. **Audit Logs**

- **Activity Monitoring**:  
  Maintain detailed audit logs for all critical actions (e.g., rent payments, lease renewals, maintenance requests) to ensure accountability and track changes for security purposes.

### **Advanced Features**

#### 1. **AI-Powered Chat Assistant**

- **Tenant Support Assistant**:  
  Integrate an AI-powered chat assistant that can handle common tenant inquiries, assist with the application process, provide status updates for maintenance requests, and offer rent payment reminders.

#### 2. **Data Analytics and Insights**

- **Rent Payment Trends**:  
  Provide landlords with data-driven insFights, such as trends in rent payments, overdue rates, and tenant retention rates to help them make informed business decisions.
- **Maintenance Request Analytics**:  
  Track maintenance request patterns to help landlords identify recurring issues and prioritize property improvements.
