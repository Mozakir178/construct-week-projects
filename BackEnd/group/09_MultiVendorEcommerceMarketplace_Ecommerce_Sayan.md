### **Multi-Vendor E-Commerce Marketplace Backend System**

**Context:**  
A multi-vendor marketplace allows multiple sellers to offer their products on the same platform, similar to e-commerce giants like **Etsy** or **Amazon**. This project focuses on building a backend system that supports vendor management, product listings, order processing, payment integration, and reviewsâ€”all through API endpoints and automated workflows without the need for a frontend.

**Project Goal:**  
To create a scalable backend system that handles multi-vendor operations, allowing vendors to manage their stores while administrators maintain overall marketplace control, including payment processing, inventory tracking, and customer feedback.

     Build APIs to handle partial and full refunds. Ensure secure processing of refunds and maintain records for each transaction, including reasons for refunds and chargebacks.
- **Payment Receipts**:  
     Automatically generate payment receipts for customers and vendors after each transaction and send them via email or SMS.

#### 5. **Review and Rating System**

- **Product and Vendor Reviews**:  
     Allow customers to leave reviews and rate products and vendors. Vendors can respond to reviews, and admins can monitor and moderate feedback for inappropriate content.
- **Review Management API**:  
     Develop an API for vendors to see customer reviews for their products and overall store, enabling them to improve based on feedback. Admins can have the ability to approve or remove reviews flagged for violations.
- **Rating Calculation**:  
     Build functionality to automatically calculate average ratings for products and vendors, updating in real-time as new reviews are added.

#### 6. **Admin Control and Marketplace Oversight**

- **Vendor Approval Process**:  
     Build an admin-controlled approval process for vendors to list their products. Admins can approve or reject vendor applications based on marketplace standards.
- **Dispute Resolution**:  
     Provide tools for admins to intervene in disputes between customers and vendors. Track dispute history, offer mediation options, and enforce refunds or other solutions when necessary.
- **Platform Commission Settings**:  
     Admins should be able to configure platform fees and commission rates. This can be a flat fee per sale or a percentage-based model.

#### 7. **Analytics and Reports**

- **Vendor Sales Analytics**:  
     Provide API endpoints that vendors can use to access key metrics like total sales, top-selling products, and revenue trends over time. Allow vendors to filter reports by date range, product category, or customer location.
- **Marketplace Performance Reports**:  
     Admins should be able to generate reports on the overall performance of the marketplace, including total sales volume, vendor activity, and customer satisfaction.
- **Order Trends and Metrics**:  
     Vendors can get insights into order trends such as peak order times, average order value, and customer demographics. Admins can use this data to improve marketplace operations and marketing efforts.

#### 8. **Security and Compliance**

- **Data Security**:  
     Implement strict security measures, including encryption of sensitive data (like customer payment details and vendor banking information) and compliance with standards like **PCI-DSS** for payment processing.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:  
     Ensure that only authorized users (admins, vendors) can access sensitive data through role-based access controls. Vendors can only access their own data, while admins can access everything.
- **Audit Logs**:  
     Maintain an audit log of all actions taken by vendors and admins, such as product updates, order processing, and financial transactions, for accountability and troubleshooting.
- **GDPR and CCPA Compliance**:  
     Provide features to comply with data privacy regulations, such as **GDPR** and **CCPA**. This includes options for customers to view, edit, or delete their personal data.
