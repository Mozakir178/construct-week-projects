### **Frontend Focus**  

#### **1. Interactive Event Creation Wizard**

- **Step-by-Step Process:** Design a multi-step event creation wizard that guides users through each stage of creating an event, including setting up the event details, location, and invitees.
- **Dynamic Maps Integration:** Integrate interactive maps (e.g., Google Maps API) for location selection, allowing users to search for venues, visualize locations, and set precise event addresses.
- **Date and Time Pickers:** Implement user-friendly date and time pickers with smart suggestions based on availability (e.g., highlighting popular times or weekends).
- **Media Upload Features:** Provide drag-and-drop functionality for users to upload event banners, images, or videos. Include editing tools for adjusting media before finalizing the event creation.

#### **2. Comprehensive RSVP Tracking**

- **Visual RSVP Dashboard:** Create an appealing RSVP dashboard where users can view attendee statuses at a glance, including who is attending, who hasn't responded, and any notes from invitees.
- **Color-Coded Status Indicators:** Use color-coding (e.g., green for attending, yellow for maybe, red for not attending) to visually represent the RSVP status of invitees, making it easy for users to gauge attendance.
- **Automated Reminders:** Implement a feature to send automated reminders to guests who have not yet responded, with customizable reminder settings (e.g., 1 week before, 1 day before).

#### **3. Detailed Event Timeline**

- **Chronological Display:** Develop an event timeline view that presents both upcoming and past events chronologically, allowing users to see their event history and future commitments at a glance.
- **Filter and Search Options:** Include filtering options to allow users to sort events by type (e.g., public, private, RSVP-only) and search functionality to quickly locate specific events.
- **Event Highlights:** Provide highlights for each event, displaying key details like the number of attendees, location, date, and links to the event page for easy access.

#### **4. Enhanced User Engagement Features**

- **Invitation Customization:** Allow users to create and customize invitations, choosing from pre-designed templates or creating their own with personalized messages and images.
- **Social Sharing Options:** Integrate social media sharing capabilities, enabling users to promote their events on various platforms, thereby increasing visibility and attendance.
- **Event Discussion Forum:** Create a discussion forum or comment section for each event, allowing attendees to interact, ask questions, and share updates before and after the event.

#### **5. Seamless User Experience and Onboarding**

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Design a clean, intuitive interface that guides users through the event creation and management process without overwhelming them with options.
- **Onboarding Tour:** Implement an onboarding tour for new users to familiarize them with the platform's features and functionalities, ensuring they can navigate easily.

**Optional AI Feature:**  

- **AI-Powered Event Recommendations:** Use AI algorithms to analyze user interests and past event participation to recommend upcoming events that align with their preferences, enhancing user engagement and attendance.
