### Loan Application System

**Context:**  
Loan application systems make it easier for users to apply for loans, track their application status, and manage their repayment schedule. A well-designed interface enhances user experience by guiding applicants through the process and ensuring clarity around the status of their loans.

**Project Goal:**  
Develop an intuitive loan application portal where users can submit applications, view the approval process in real-time, and manage loan repayment schedules with clear visual tools and reminders.

### Key Frontend Features

#### 1. **Multi-Step Loan Application Form**

- **Feature Description:** Create a user-friendly, multi-step loan application form that collects necessary details in a logical, easy-to-follow process.
- **Frontend Focus:**
  - **Progress Indicators:** Design a progress bar or step-by-step breadcrumb at the top of the form, showing the current step (e.g., personal info, financial details, document uploads) and remaining steps. Use smooth animations to transition between form steps.
  - **Real-Time Validation:** Implement real-time validation for form inputs (e.g., email format, income verification), showing error messages as the user fills out each field. Provide tooltips for additional guidance on tricky fields.
  - **Animated Form Transitions:** Use subtle animations to enhance the user experience when moving between form steps, such as sliding cards or fading transitions, ensuring a seamless flow from one step to the next.

#### 2. **Loan Status Tracking Dashboard**

- **Feature Description:** Provide a dashboard where users can view the status of their loan applications at any stage, from submission to approval or denial.
- **Frontend Focus:**
  - **Visual Progress Bars:** Implement visually engaging progress bars that reflect where a loan application is in the approval process (e.g., “Submitted,” “Under Review,” “Approved”). Make these progress bars dynamic, updating in real time as the status changes.
  - **Status Notifications:** Integrate real-time notifications for key milestones, such as when a loan moves from one stage to another. Use toast notifications or in-app alerts to inform users about status updates.
  - **Document Upload and Verification Status:** Allow users to see the status of uploaded documents (e.g., “Pending Review,” “Approved,” “Requires Resubmission”) with visual markers and color-coded badges for clarity.

#### 3. **Interactive Repayment Calendar**

- **Feature Description:** Create a visually appealing and interactive repayment schedule, allowing users to view upcoming and past-due payments.
- **Frontend Focus:**
  - **Calendar View:** Design an interactive calendar where users can see scheduled payment dates. Use color-coded markers (e.g., green for paid, red for overdue, yellow for upcoming) to indicate the status of each payment.
  - **Payment Summaries:** On hover or tap, provide detailed payment summaries for each due date, including the amount, payment status, and any interest or fees. Include CTA buttons like “Make Payment” or “Request Extension.”
  - **Automated Reminders:** Implement notifications for upcoming or overdue payments, integrated with the calendar. These can be displayed as pop-ups in the app or sent via push notifications, reminding users of due dates.

#### 4. **Loan Comparison Tool** (Optional)

- **Feature Description:** Help users compare different loan options (e.g., personal loans, student loans, mortgage) based on interest rates, terms, and monthly payments.
- **Frontend Focus:**
