### **Tenant-Landlord Communication Platform**

#### **Context:**

Effective communication between tenants and landlords is crucial for property management, resolving maintenance issues, and handling rent payments. However, managing multiple conversations, maintenance requests, and payment tracking can be overwhelming for both parties without a centralized system. This platform aims to streamline the communication process and improve transparency.

#### **Project Goal:**

Build a frontend-focused tenant-landlord communication platform that facilitates efficient interaction, allowing tenants to report issues, track maintenance requests, and communicate seamlessly with landlords. The goal is to create an intuitive, user-friendly interface for both tenants and landlords to stay informed and address issues promptly.

### **Frontend Focused Features:**

#### 1. **Intuitive Maintenance Request System:**

- **Interactive Submission Form:**  
     Create a clean, step-by-step form where tenants can report maintenance issues. Tenants can categorize the issue (e.g., plumbing, electrical, general), select the urgency level (low, medium, high), and provide detailed descriptions. Add drag-and-drop support for uploading images or videos.
- **Auto-Suggestions for Common Issues:**  
     Implement an auto-suggestion feature that suggests common issues as tenants type, reducing manual input and ensuring consistency in issue reporting.

- **Real-Time Validation and Feedback:**  
     Use real-time form validation to ensure that all required information is entered correctly. Provide instant feedback if fields are left incomplete or contain invalid data.

#### 2. **Issue Tracking Dashboard:**

- **Tenant View:**  
     Create a personalized dashboard for tenants that displays the status of submitted requests (e.g., pending, in progress, completed). Use visual indicators like colored badges and progress bars to represent the current state of each request.
- **Landlord View:**  
     Landlords can view all reported issues in a categorized, filterable table. They can filter by property, issue type, urgency, or status, and update issue statuses to keep tenants informed.

- **Timeline of Actions:**  
     For each maintenance request, provide a detailed timeline view showing when the request was submitted, when it was reviewed, and when it was completed. This gives both tenants and landlords clear visibility of the process.

#### 3. **Instant Messaging System:**

- **Tenant-Landlord Messaging Threads:**  
     Implement a chat interface for real-time communication between tenants and landlords. Display previous conversations and allow new messages to be sent quickly, enhancing direct communication for questions or clarifications.

- **Message Status Indicators:**  
     Include status indicators such as "sent," "delivered," and "read" to give users clear visibility into the message flow. Provide timestamps for each message.

- **Push Notifications and Alerts:**  
     Add notifications for when new messages are received or if a maintenance request status changes. Notifications should be dismissible and displayed as popups for immediate attention.

#### 4. **Maintenance History and Reports:**

- **Maintenance Record for Each Property:**  
     Create a section that allows landlords to track the history of all maintenance requests for each property. This provides an at-a-glance overview of how often certain issues arise and helps landlords prioritize future maintenance.

- **Exportable Maintenance Reports:**  
     Enable landlords to export maintenance history into CSV or PDF formats for record-keeping or sharing with property management companies.

#### 5. **Rent Payment Tracker:**

- **Payment History:**  
     Build a dedicated section where tenants can view past rent payments, due dates, and amounts. Use a visual calendar view to help tenants track upcoming rent deadlines and landlords monitor payment status.

- **Interactive Rent Reminders:**  
     Tenants receive a reminder with an interactive element where they can mark the payment as "completed" or request a delay, notifying landlords of payment status in real-time.

- **Payment Status Dashboard for Landlords:**  
     Landlords can view rent payment statuses across properties, identifying overdue payments and sending reminders with one click.

#### 6. **Responsive Design with Mobile Optimization:**

- **Mobile-First Approach:**  
     Ensure the entire platform is optimized for mobile use, allowing tenants and landlords to access the platform on smartphones. Prioritize touch-friendly interactions for submitting requests, viewing message threads, and tracking payments.

- **Adaptive UI for Larger Screens:**  
     Create a responsive design that adapts to larger screen sizes like tablets or desktops, providing an enhanced experience with additional details visible without cluttering the interface.

#### 7. **User Profiles and Customization:**

- **Personalized Tenant Profiles:**  
     Tenants can customize their profiles by uploading avatars, contact information, and preferred communication methods (e.g., email, SMS).

- **Landlord Management Console:**  
     Landlords can manage multiple properties through a single dashboard. The console can show which tenants are assigned to each property and allow landlords to configure settings for each property (e.g., contact preferences, rent amounts).

#### 8. **Interactive Maintenance Scheduling:**

- **Appointment Booking System for Repairs:**  
     Allow tenants to schedule a time for maintenance personnel to visit. Tenants can select preferred times from an available time slot calendar, and landlords can approve or reschedule as needed.

- **Real-Time Updates:**  
     When maintenance is in progress, tenants can receive updates (e.g., technician arrival time, issue resolved) via the dashboard, keeping them informed throughout the process.

#### 9. **Multi-Language Support:**

- **Language Toggle Feature:**  
     Include a language selection feature where tenants and landlords can choose their preferred language, ensuring the platform is accessible to a broader audience, especially in regions with diverse populations.
