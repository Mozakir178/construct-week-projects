### **Minimum Expected Features**

These features represent the core functionality required to build a basic e-commerce platform.

1. **User Authentication**

   - Implement secure login and signup functionality for both vendors and customers. Authentication should allow vendors to access their store management dashboard, while customers can manage their purchases and profile. This should include basic security features like password encryption and email verification.

2. **Product Listing Management**

   - Allow vendors to manage their product listings, including adding new products, editing existing ones, and deleting them when necessary. Vendors should be able to upload images, write descriptions, and set prices for each product. This feature should be accessible from a user-friendly vendor dashboard with clear options for managing multiple products at once.

3. **Product Search and Filter**

   - Implement a search bar where customers can search for products by name, category, or price. Additionally, integrate filter options like price range, ratings, and availability. This feature enhances the customer’s ability to find specific products easily and improves the overall user experience.

4. **Shopping Cart and Checkout**

   - Enable customers to add products to a shopping cart, with the ability to modify quantities or remove items before proceeding to checkout. The checkout process should be straightforward, integrating a basic payment gateway (e.g., Stripe or PayPal) to handle transactions securely. Customers should receive an order confirmation after completing the purchase.

5. **Order Management for Customers and Vendors**

   - Implement separate order management features for both customers and vendors. Customers should be able to view their order history, check order status (e.g., pending, shipped, delivered), and track deliveries. Vendors should have access to incoming orders, where they can update order status, prepare for shipment, and mark items as shipped.

6. **Product Reviews and Ratings**

   - Allow customers to leave reviews and provide ratings for products they have purchased. This feature enables other users to assess the quality of products based on previous buyers' experiences, helping to build trust in the platform.

7. **Product Categories**

   - Organize products into distinct categories (e.g., clothing, electronics, home goods) for easy browsing. The platform should display categories in an accessible way, allowing users to navigate by category or filter products within a selected category.

8. **Discount Coupons and Promotions**
   - Enable vendors to create and manage discount codes or promotional offers for their products. This feature should include the ability to set expiration dates, percentage-based discounts, or specific product promotions, giving vendors flexibility in their marketing strategies.

### **Unique Features**

These features highlight the student’s creativity and ability to add value to the project, giving the platform a more dynamic user experience.

1. **Wishlist**

   - Allow customers to add products to a wishlist for future purchases. This feature should be integrated into the customer’s profile, where they can easily review and purchase items saved to their wishlist. The wishlist can also include stock alerts, notifying customers if a product they have saved is `running low` or `back in stock`.

2. **Vendor-Specific Dashboards with Sales Insights**

   - Develop a detailed vendor dashboard that displays key performance metrics such as total sales, most popular products, and customer demographics. Vendors should be able to track their sales trends over time, view which products are performing well, and gain insights into their target audience. This dashboard should include simple graphs or charts for data visualization.

3. **Vendor-Specific Shop Pages with Customizable Layouts**

   - Give vendors their own storefront page where they can showcase their brand and customize the layout. Vendors should be able to add a logo, change colors, and organize their products into featured sections (e.g., "New Arrivals" or "On Sale"). This feature provides vendors with a more personalized space on the platform and gives them more control over how their products are presented.

   - sample guidelines will be like `Stock` Clearance (Products in stock more than 6 Months), `New Arrival` (less than 1 month), `On Sale` (within 1 to 3 months)

4. **Secure Link Generation for Sharing Products with Expiry, Product Referal**

   - Create a feature that allows vendors to generate secure shareable links for their products, which they can send to potential customers. These links should have an expiration date, and should proviude a special discount. This feature enhances product marketing and allows vendors to run time-limited promotions in a controlled way.

### **Challenging Features**

These advanced features push the student to think critically and implement more complex functionality, adding significant value to the platform.

1. **Inventory Management with Low Stock Alerts**

   - Vendors can manage the stock levels of their products, with automatic low-stock alerts when inventory levels fall below a certain threshold. This feature allows vendors to stay on top of inventory needs, ensuring products remain available for customers. Vendors should also be able to view a simple report of stock levels on their dashboard.

2. **Customer Order Tracking**

   - Implement a customer order tracking system where customers can see live updates of their order’s journey, from order confirmation to shipment and delivery. This could include status updates like "Order Received," "In Process," "Shipped," and "Delivered." Each step should be clearly indicated on a timeline view, making it easier for customers to know when to expect their items.

3. **Advanced Product Filters**

   - In addition to basic filters, introduce more advanced filtering options, such as brand, size, material, and even vendor-specific filters. This feature allows customers to drill down into specific product attributes, improving their search experience and helping them find exactly what they are looking for.

4. **Dashboard for Referral Tracking**
   This feature allows vendors to generate referral links for products or their storefront, track customer interactions, and monitor conversion rates. The dashboard provides detailed insights such as when the link was clicked, which products were viewed, whether an order was placed, and the quantity of items purchased. Vendors can also filter referral data by date, product, or referral source to analyze the effectiveness of their referral campaigns, helping them optimize marketing strategies and improve sales.
5. **AI-Powered Product Recommendations for Customers**
   - Implement AI-powered product recommendations based on the customer’s browsing history, previous purchases, and interactions with the platform. The AI should analyze customer preferences and suggest products they might be interested in. This enhances user engagement, making the shopping experience more personalized and potentially increasing sales for vendors.

1. **Dark Mode**

   - Provide a toggle for users to switch between light and dark modes, improving usability in different lighting environments.

2. **Responsive Design**
   - Ensure the platform is fully responsive, delivering a seamless experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
