### **Book Club Platform**

#### **Context**

Liam and his friends, passionate readers, created an online platform to share their love of books, suggest new titles, track reading progress, and participate in discussions. This project aims to create a fully frontend-driven web platform to foster a sense of community, allowing members to collaborate, stay motivated, and discover new reads.

### **Project Goal**

The goal is to build an engaging and interactive frontend platform where users can suggest, discuss, and track books, set reading goals, and engage with the club community. The platform should be intuitive, responsive, and feature-rich, designed to enhance user engagement and reading habits.

### **Frontend-Focused Features**

#### 1. **Dynamic Book Suggestion System:**

- **Add and Display Book Suggestions:**  
     Create a form for users to suggest books, allowing them to input the title, author, and a brief description. Display the suggested books in a dynamic, sortable list that updates in real-time as new suggestions are added.

- **Real-Time Voting System:**  
     Implement an upvoting mechanism where members can vote on book suggestions. Update the list with real-time vote counts, allowing users to see the current top selections without refreshing the page.

- **Interactive Vote Results Display:**  
     Use graphical elements (e.g., bar charts or badges) to visually show voting results, making it easier for users to track which book is leading the polls.

#### 2. **Interactive Discussion Forums:**

- **Threaded Discussion Boards:**  
     Build a structured, intuitive interface for book-specific or chapter-specific discussion threads. Users should be able to comment, reply, and like messages, with real-time updates for seamless interaction.

- **Rich Text Editor for Comments:**  
     Enhance the commenting experience by integrating a rich text editor for formatting (bold, italic, bullet points) and adding links or quotes. Enable users to easily express detailed opinions and arguments.

- **Pagination and Search in Discussions:**  
     Implement pagination for lengthy discussion threads and a search function that allows users to quickly find specific discussions or comments related to a book.

#### 3. **Visual Reading Progress Tracker:**

- **Reading Progress Bars:**  
     Provide users with a progress bar that visually represents how much of a book they’ve read, updating as they log their progress (e.g., in percentage or by chapters/pages). This can be managed via a simple input form for users to update their progress.

- **Daily and Weekly Progress Notifications:**  
     Design notifications that prompt users to log their reading progress and display milestones for chapters or percentage completion, keeping them motivated.

#### 4. **Monthly Recap Dashboard:**

- **Automated Summary Widget:**  
     Develop a widget on the homepage that automatically summarizes the club’s monthly activity. Include stats like most-discussed books, top-rated titles, most active members, and key discussion points.

- **Highlight Quotes and Ratings:**  
     Use a clean layout to display highlighted quotes and ratings from users for each book discussed, giving members a snapshot of the club's shared insights.

#### 5. **Personal Reading Goals and Tracking:**

- **Goal-Setting Form:**  
     Create an interactive form where users can set personal reading goals (e.g., number of books, pages to read within a specific timeframe). Goals should be prominently displayed on the user’s dashboard with progress indicators.

- **Progress Monitoring Widgets:**  
     Use visual widgets (progress circles, charts) to show users how close they are to reaching their reading goals, encouraging regular reading.

#### 6. **Book Ratings and Review System:**

- **Rating Stars and Review Submission:**  
     Implement a rating system that allows users to rate books out of five stars. Pair this with a review form where users can submit detailed feedback about their reading experience.

- **Display and Sort Reviews:**  
     Reviews should be dynamically displayed on each book’s detail page, with options for sorting by most recent or highest rated. Include visual cues like ratings, number of reviews, and featured reviews.

#### 7. **Personalized Book Recommendations:**

- **Recommendation Algorithm UI:**  
     Based on each user’s reading history and reviews, build a frontend module that displays personalized book recommendations. Allow users to filter suggestions by genre, author, or rating.

- **Interactive Book Discovery Section:**  
     Include a book discovery section with carousel sliders and grids showcasing personalized recommendations, trending titles, and new book suggestions, optimized for both desktop and mobile.

#### 8. **Virtual Book Club Meetings Integration:**

- **Meeting Scheduling UI:**  
     Create an easy-to-use interface where users can schedule virtual meetings, with a calendar view that shows upcoming events. Allow users to RSVP directly from the platform.

- **Video/Audio Integration Placeholder:**  
     Include placeholders for third-party video/audio conferencing tools (e.g., Zoom, Google Meet) with integrated buttons to join or schedule meetings, making virtual discussions seamless.

#### 9. **Notification and Activity Feed System:**

- **Real-Time Notifications:**  
     Build a notification system that alerts users to new book suggestions, discussion responses, progress updates, or virtual meeting schedules. Notifications should be accessible through a dropdown or sidebar.

- **Activity Feed Component:**  
     Design a personalized activity feed that shows the latest updates, such as books finished by members, new reviews, or upcoming meetings. The feed should be dynamic, updating in real time.

#### 10. **Personal Library Management:**

- **Categorize and Organize Books:**  
     Provide users with a personal library interface where they can organize books into categories like “Currently Reading,” “Read,” and “To Read.” This feature should have drag-and-drop functionality for easy management.

- **Customizable Shelves:**  
     Allow users to create custom shelves for grouping books by genre, author, or personal preference, with options to add notes or tags to each book.

#### 11. **Book Club Statistics and Achievements:**

- **Club-Wide Statistics Display:**  
     Develop a statistics dashboard that tracks the overall progress of the book club. Include metrics like total books read, average rating, and the number of active discussions.
