### **Home Improvement Tracker**

**Context**: John was juggling several home renovation projects and found it difficult to keep track of progress, manage budgets, and stay organized. To simplify his renovation process, John began using a home improvement tracker app that helped him manage every aspect of his projects, from material purchases to contractor scheduling, all in one place.

### **Project Goal**

- The goal is to create a project management app tailored to home improvement, allowing users to plan, budget, and track renovations efficiently. By providing tools for tracking progress, managing costs, and organizing tasks, the app helps users stay motivated and organized throughout their home improvement journey.

- This **Home Improvement Tracker** project is designed to keep users like John organized, motivated, and informed throughout the renovation process. With features like progress tracking, budgeting, and material management, the app streamlines complex home improvement tasks, making renovations more efficient and enjoyable.

### **Features**

- **Comprehensive Project Management**: John can create new renovation projects (e.g., kitchen remodel, bathroom update), assign deadlines, and break them down into smaller tasks. He can track each task’s progress, ensuring the project stays on schedule. Tasks are organized by priority, allowing John to focus on critical steps first.

- **Progress Photos and Documentation**: John can upload before-and-after photos for each stage of the renovation, documenting the transformation in real-time. These photos are linked to specific tasks, making it easy to see the progress for each part of the project.

- **Budget Tracking and Expense Management**: The app tracks John's spending, providing detailed insights into material and service costs. He can set a budget for each project and track expenses to ensure he stays within budget limits. The app generates a financial overview, showing cost breakdowns and overall expenditures.

- **Task Reminders and Scheduling**: John can set reminders for important tasks, like when to order materials, schedule contractor visits, or complete a specific renovation phase. He receives notifications at key times, ensuring that no part of the project is overlooked.

- **Material Shopping List and Cost Estimation**: Based on the project requirements, the app automatically generates a shopping list for materials, along with price estimates. John can add items to his list, mark off purchases, and track how much he’s spending on each item.

- **Contractor Management and Contacts**: The app allows John to store contractor details, such as phone numbers, email addresses, and past project information. He can directly contact contractors through the app to schedule appointments or inquire about services.

- **Project Inspiration and Design Ideas**: The app suggests design ideas, DIY tutorials, and renovation tips based on John’s current projects. He can browse inspiration galleries and get recommendations for similar renovation styles or materials.

- **Time and Progress Estimation**: For each task and overall project, the app provides estimated completion times based on the tasks created and deadlines set. This helps John gauge how long different phases of the renovation might take.

- **Task Assignment and Collaboration**: If John is working with family members or contractors, he can assign specific tasks to each person and track their progress. This collaborative feature helps delegate work and monitor the contributions of each participant.

- **Inventory Management**: John can log all tools, materials, and equipment he already owns into the app’s inventory system, ensuring he avoids unnecessary purchases and keeps track of what’s on hand.

- **Home Maintenance Schedule**: Beyond home improvements, the app also serves as a home maintenance planner. It reminds John of periodic maintenance tasks, such as HVAC servicing, roof inspections, or seasonal yard work, helping him stay proactive about home care.

- **Permit and Regulation Tracking**: For more complex projects, the app tracks any required permits or local regulations, ensuring that John’s renovations stay compliant with local building codes.

- **Customizable Project Templates**: The app offers customizable project templates for common renovations (e.g., bathroom remodel, kitchen update, landscaping), giving John a quick starting point for new projects with pre-set tasks and timelines.

- **Expense Export and Reporting**: At the end of a project, John can export a detailed report of his spending, progress, and photos to PDF, providing a complete overview of the renovation for personal records or future reference.
