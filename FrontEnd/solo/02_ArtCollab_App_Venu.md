### **ArtCollab_App**

#### Context:

Artists often find it difficult to connect with others for collaborative projects. This app aims to create a platform for artists to collaborate and share their work.

#### Project Goal:

Create a platform where artists from various fields (painters, musicians, writers, digital artists) can connect, collaborate on projects, share ideas, and provide feedback.

### **Minimum Expected Features**

These features are foundational and provide the essential functionality for the app.

1. **User Authentication**

   - Implement a secure login and registration system, allowing users to sign up with email and password. Additionally, enable social media authentication (e.g., Google, Facebook) to make it easier for artists to quickly register and access the app.

2. **Profile Customization**

   - Allow users to create their own profiles with basic information such as name, bio, and profile picture. Artists can also showcase their skills and fields of expertise (e.g., painter, digital artist, musician). They should be able to upload samples of their work (images, audio, etc.) to their portfolio section, which is visible to other users.

3. **Project Collaboration**

   - Enable users to create collaborative projects, where they can set the project title, description, and invite other artists to join. This feature will allow multiple users to work together on the same project, with the ability to view and contribute content related to the collaboration.

4. **Art Sharing and Feedback**

   - Allow users to upload their artwork to the platform (images, audio, or text) and receive feedback in the form of comments from other users. A simple commenting feature will allow community members to engage in discussions and provide constructive feedback.

5. **Artwork Categories**
   - Organize artworks into categories such as painting, sculpture, music, digital art, and more. Implement filtering and search functionality so users can easily browse through various categories based on their interest.

### **Unique Features**

These features add depth to the platform, enhancing its appeal and showcasing the student’s creativity.

1. **In-App Chat**

   - Implement a real-time chat feature, allowing artists working on a project to communicate with each other without leaving the platform. This chat should support both one-on-one messaging and group discussions related to a collaborative project.

2. **Live Collaboration Room**

   - Create a feature where artists can collaborate in real-time using a shared digital canvas or workspace. For instance, users should be able to draw together on the same canvas or co-write text. While this can be simple, the real-time aspect will make it unique and engaging for users.

3. **Events and Challenges**

   - Host events and art challenges that encourage artists to showcase their creativity. For example, create monthly art challenges where users submit work based on a theme, and community members can vote for their favorite entries. Events like virtual exhibitions can also be organized where users can showcase their work to the broader community.

4. **Connect with Collaborators**
   - Implement a "matchmaking" system that suggests collaborators based on artists' skills, interests, and project types. For example, if a user is a digital artist looking for a musician for a multimedia project, they can search or be automatically matched with potential collaborators based on their profile.

### **Challenging Features**

These features are technically challenging and push the student to go beyond basic app development.

1. **Autosave Feature**

   - Implement an autosave function that saves progress automatically when users are working on a project, such as creating artwork on a shared canvas. This will ensure that no work is lost if there’s an accidental page refresh or a session timeout, providing a seamless user experience.

2. **Export Art Projects**

   - Enable users to export their collaborative art projects in various formats. For example, allow visual artwork to be exported as image files (JPEG, PNG) and multimedia projects as video or audio files. Users should have the option to download either individual pieces or the entire project.

3. **Dashboard with Analytics**

   - Develop a user dashboard where artists can see metrics related to their engagement. For example, show the number of projects they are working on, successful collaborations completed, total feedback received, and how many artists they have connected with. This will provide insights into their activity and interactions within the community.

4. **AI-Based Artwork Suggestions**
   - Integrate AI to suggest art prompts or ideas based on the user’s profile, interests, and past work. For example, if a user frequently creates digital paintings, the AI could suggest new themes, color schemes, or subject matter to explore. This will provide artists with creative inspiration and personalized recommendations.

### **Additional Features**

These features are enhancements but not critical to the project. They can be added if time permits.

1. **Dark Mode**

   - Provide a dark mode option to enhance user comfort, especially when working for long periods or in low-light environments. Implement a simple toggle that allows users to switch between light and dark themes.

2. **Responsive Design**
   - Ensure the app is fully responsive, meaning it should work seamlessly across different devices such as desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. This involves adjusting layouts, font sizes, and interactions for optimal user experience on various screen sizes.
