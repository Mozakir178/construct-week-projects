**Gardening Planner**

**Context**: Isabella had a passion for gardening but often found it hard to keep track of when and how to care for her various plants throughout the year. To simplify her gardening routine and ensure healthier plants, she started using a gardening planner app that helps her manage all aspects of her garden, from plant care to pest control.

### **Project Goal**
