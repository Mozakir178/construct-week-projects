### **Grocery List Manager**

**Context**: Liam often found himself forgetting key ingredients when shopping, leading to frustrating last-minute trips back to the store. To streamline his grocery shopping experience and reduce food waste, Liam started using a grocery list manager app that not only helps him remember everything he needs but also suggests meals he can prepare with the ingredients he has on hand.

### **Project Goal**

- The goal is to create a smart, efficient, and user-friendly grocery list manager that organizes shopping lists, suggests recipes based on available ingredients, tracks pantry items, and helps users stay within their budget. This platform should simplify grocery planning, reduce food waste, and enhance the overall shopping experience.

- This **Grocery List Manager** project aims to streamline grocery shopping by offering personalized suggestions, budgeting tools, and pantry management features. It’s designed to reduce food waste, improve meal planning, and make shopping a more efficient and cost-effective experience for users like Liam.

### **Features**

- **Smart List Creation and Organization**: Liam can easily create his grocery list, and the app automatically organizes items by store section (e.g., produce, dairy, bakery). This makes it more efficient to shop by grouping items that are located in the same part of the store, saving Liam both time and effort during his grocery runs.

- **Recipe Suggestions Based on Ingredients**: The app goes beyond just managing his shopping list—it suggests recipes Liam can prepare based on the ingredients he already has at home or those he’s planning to buy. This ensures he makes the most out of his groceries and minimizes food waste.

- **Shareable and Collaborative Lists**: Liam can share his grocery list with family members or roommates, allowing everyone to add, update, or cross off items in real time. This makes it easy for the household to collaborate on shopping without missing anything important.

- **Price Estimation and Budgeting**: The app provides estimated costs for all the items on Liam’s list, helping him stay within his grocery budget. He can see the total cost of his list and adjust items based on how much he’s willing to spend that week.

- **Dietary Preferences and Restrictions**: The app filters recipes and food suggestions based on dietary preferences or restrictions, such as vegetarian, gluten-free, or low-carb. This ensures that all recipe recommendations align with Liam’s health and lifestyle choices.

- **Coupon and Deal Integration**: The app is integrated with local stores, showing Liam any available coupons or deals for the items on his list. This allows him to save money by purchasing discounted products or using applicable coupons during checkout.

- **Pantry Management and Inventory Tracking**: The app tracks what items Liam already has at home by maintaining a virtual pantry. As Liam uses or adds groceries, the app updates his pantry, letting him know when he’s running low on certain ingredients and reminding him to restock.

- **Meal Planning and Scheduling**: Liam can plan his meals for the week within the app, and the platform will automatically add the necessary ingredients to his grocery list. This feature ensures that all meals are accounted for during his shopping trip.

- **Shopping Mode**: When Liam is at the store, he can switch to “Shopping Mode,” which provides a simplified, easy-to-check-off version of his list that updates as he shops. It also sorts items by store layout, making it even faster for him to find what he needs.

- **Expiration Date Tracking**: The app allows Liam to track expiration dates for perishable items, sending reminders to use them before they go bad. This helps reduce food waste and ensures he’s making the most out of his purchases.

- **Nutritional Information and Health Tracking**: As part of his grocery list and recipes, the app provides detailed nutritional information, allowing Liam to track his calorie, protein, and nutrient intake based on the foods he buys and the meals he prepares.

- **Shopping History and Trends**: The app keeps track of Liam’s shopping habits and spending over time, providing insights into his most frequently purchased items, total grocery spending, and patterns that could help him optimize future grocery trips.
