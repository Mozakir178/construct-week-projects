#### Context

Cooking can be a fun and creative activity, but keeping track of recipes can be cumbersome. This app allows users to organize, create, and share recipes effortlessly.

#### Project Goal

Develop a digital recipe book app that lets users store, organize, and share their favorite recipes, making cooking more accessible and enjoyable.

### **Minimum Expected Features**

These features are essential for the basic functionality of the app.

1. **User Authentication**

   - Implement a secure login and registration system using email and password. Users can create personal accounts to access and manage their saved recipes.

2. **Recipe Creation**

   - Develop a form that allows users to create and save their recipes, including fields for the recipe name, ingredients, cooking instructions, and cooking time. Ensure that the recipes are stored in a database for retrieval.

3. **Recipe Categories**

   - Allow users to categorize their recipes into predefined groups (e.g., appetizers, main courses, desserts) for easier navigation and organization of their recipe collections.

4. **Ingredient Search**

   - Implement a search feature that enables users to find recipes based on the ingredients they have. Users can enter ingredients, and the app will return relevant recipes that match their query.

5. **Photo Uploads**

   - Enable users to upload photos of their completed dishes alongside their recipes. This feature encourages users to share their cooking successes visually, enhancing the community aspect.

6. **Sharing Recipes**
   - Provide a feature for users to share their recipes through social media or via direct links. This will help users promote their favorite recipes and engage with their friends.

### **Unique Features**

These features enhance user experience and showcase the student's creativity.

1. **Meal Planning Feature**

   - Allow users to create a weekly meal plan by selecting recipes for each day. The app should automatically generate a shopping list based on the selected recipes, categorizing items for efficient shopping.

2. **User Ratings and Reviews**

   - Implement a ratings system where users can rate recipes on a scale of 1 to 5 stars and leave reviews. This will help others make informed decisions and foster community engagement.

3. **Cooking Timer**

   - Include a built-in timer that users can start and stop during the cooking process. Users should be able to set multiple timers for different steps in their recipes, improving their cooking management.

4. **Dashboard with Analytics**
   - Create a user dashboard that displays analytics, such as the number of recipes saved and the most popular recipes among users. This feature will provide users with insights into their cooking habits and help them discover new recipes.

### **Challenging Features**

1. **Autosave Feature**

   - Implement an autosave feature that automatically saves recipe drafts as users input information. This will ensure that users do not lose their progress if they navigate away from the page or experience a technical issue.

2. **Export Recipe Book**

   - Allow users to export their recipe collection as a well-formatted PDF document. Users should be able to choose specific recipes or export the entire collection, making it easier to share their culinary creations outside the app.

3. **AI Recipe Suggestions**
   - Integrate a basic AI component that suggests recipes based on user preferences and available ingredients. This feature could use simple algorithms to recommend recipes that align with the user's tastes and inventory, enhancing engagement and satisfaction.

### **Additional Features**

These features enhance the app's usability and aesthetics, making it more appealing and accessible.

1. **Dark Mode**

   - Implement a toggle feature that allows users to switch between light and dark themes. This will enhance the app's accessibility, providing a comfortable viewing experience in different lighting conditions.

2. **Responsive Design**

   - Ensure that the app is fully responsive, adjusting the layout for different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile). This will enhance user experience, making it accessible on any device.
