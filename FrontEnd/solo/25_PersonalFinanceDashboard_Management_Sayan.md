This all changed when he started using a personal finance dashboard, which gave him clear insights into his financial situation, helping him set budgets, visualize spending habits, and work towards his savings targets more effectively.

### **Project Goal**

- The goal of this personal finance dashboard is to offer Michael an organized and intuitive way to track his income, expenses, and savings while providing actionable insights and reminders to improve his overall financial health.

- The **Personal Finance Dashboard** provides Michael with an all-in-one solution for managing his finances.

### **Features**

- **Comprehensive Income and Expense Tracking**: Michael can log all of his financial transactions, including income sources like salary or freelance work, and categorize his expenses into predefined or custom categories (e.g., groceries, entertainment, rent). The app provides a complete overview of his spending habits over time, allowing Michael to easily see where his money is going.

- **Savings Goals with Progress Tracking**: Michael can set up multiple savings goals, such as saving for a vacation, emergency fund, or a new car. The dashboard provides visual progress bars for each goal, giving Michael a clear understanding of how close he is to reaching his targets. The system can also suggest adjustments if he’s falling behind on his savings plan.

- **Dynamic Budget Planner**: The app helps Michael create monthly budgets based on his spending history, and he can adjust these budgets as needed. The planner provides suggestions for more realistic budgeting based on trends in his spending, allowing Michael to set limits for categories like dining out or entertainment. If he exceeds a budget category, the app notifies him in real time.

- **Insightful Data Visualization**: The dashboard offers a suite of charts and graphs that visualize key financial metrics. Michael can easily compare his income versus expenses, see how much he’s saved each month, and monitor his budget adherence. These visual tools make it easier for Michael to identify patterns, such as recurring unnecessary expenses, and make better financial decisions.

- **Bill Reminders and Due Date Alerts**: Michael never has to worry about late payments again, as the app provides timely reminders for upcoming bills. Whether it’s utility payments, credit card bills, or subscriptions, the platform notifies Michael in advance of due dates to help him avoid late fees and penalties. The dashboard can also track automatic payments, ensuring he stays in control of his cash flow.

- **Smart Expense Categorization and Insights**: The platform automatically categorizes Michael’s transactions based on patterns it recognizes, such as groceries, transportation, or leisure spending. It also provides insights on where Michael can cut back, offering practical suggestions for saving money. For example, it might notify him that he’s spending more on dining out compared to previous months and recommend adjusting his budget.

- **Yearly Financial Overview**: The dashboard compiles Michael’s financial activity into a yearly overview, summarizing his total income, expenses, savings, and budget performance. This yearly report provides a big-picture view, helping Michael make long-term financial decisions, such as planning for investments or evaluating his annual savings growth. He can also compare year-over-year data to track his financial progress.

- **Automated Financial Reports**: The platform can generate monthly or quarterly financial reports that summarize Michael’s spending, savings, and budget performance. These reports are formatted for easy review and can be shared or exported for meetings with financial advisors or for tax preparation.

- **Customizable Alerts and Notifications**: Michael can set personalized financial alerts based on his goals or concerns. For instance, he can receive notifications when his bank balance falls below a certain threshold, when he exceeds a budget category, or when his savings reach a milestone. These custom alerts help him stay proactive in managing his finances.

- **Debt Management Tools**: If Michael has outstanding loans or credit card debt, the platform offers debt management features. It tracks his payment schedules, calculates interest, and provides a clear timeline for when his debts will be fully paid off based on his current payments. It also offers recommendations on how to speed up debt repayment by adjusting spending habits.

- **Investment Tracking**: For long-term planning, the app includes tools for tracking investments such as stocks, bonds, or retirement accounts. Michael can monitor the performance of his portfolio alongside his everyday finances, allowing him to see how his overall financial health is improving through a combination of saving, budgeting, and investing.

This consolidates all of his financial data into one dashboard, giving him a unified view of his entire financial life. The platform securely syncs data across accounts to ensure Michael always has the most up-to-date information.
